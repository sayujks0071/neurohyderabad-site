## Top Competitors

### Hospitals/Chains
1. **AIG Hospitals**: Ranks #1 for endoscopic spine surgery. Highlights "world class ICUs" and "Cranial robotics".
2. **Yashoda Hospitals**: Strong presence. Dr. Raveesh Sunkara and Dr. Sayuj Krishnan (our client) are associated here. Ranks for cost queries too.
3. **Apollo 24/7**: Aggregator-style listing for both neurosurgeons and spine surgeons.
4. **Care Hospitals**: Ranking for cost-related queries.
5. **Pristyn Care**: Heavy on "cost" and "EMI" messaging.

### Individual Surgeons
1. **Dr. Raveesh Sunkara**: `drraveesh.com`. Ranks for "best spine surgeon".
2. **Dr. Suresh Cheekatla**: `doctorforspine.com`.
3. **Dr. Sayuj Krishnan**: Found on Yashoda, Practo, Skedoc, and his own `neurosurgeon-hyderabad.odoo.com` (likely an old site).

### Aggregators
1. **Practo**: Dominates "best neurosurgeon" and "best spine surgeon" lists.
2. **Skedoc**: Strong local presence.
3. **Marham.pk**: Interesting cross-border ranking (Pakistan site ranking for Hyderabad search?).

### Content Gaps Identified
1. **Cost Transparency**: Competitors (Pristyn, Care) have dedicated cost pages. We have `spine-surgery-cost-hyderabad`, but maybe need more granular procedure costs (e.g., "Laminectomy Cost").
2. **Comparison Content**: "Microdiscectomy vs Laminectomy" has search volume but is mostly covered by international sites (Cleveland Clinic, Healthline). A local take on this ("Which is better for Hyderabad patients?") would be high-value.
3. **Recovery Specifics**: "Laminectomy recovery time" is a top query.

## Action Items
1. Create a detailed blog post comparing **Microdiscectomy vs. Laminectomy** focusing on recovery time and cost in Hyderabad.
2. Update keyword registry with new cost and comparison keywords.
