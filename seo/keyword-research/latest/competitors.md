# Competitor Research Snapshot: 2026-01-23

## Top Competitors (Local Pack & Organic)

### 1. Dr. Raveesh Sunkara (drraveesh.com)
- **Strengths:** Strong "Best Spine Surgeon" ranking, specific pages for endoscopic surgery.
- **Weaknesses:** Slower page speed, less detailed patient education compared to our planned "Super Profiles".
- **Keywords:** "endoscopic spine surgery hyderabad", "best spine surgeon hyderabad".

### 2. Apollo Hospitals (apollohospitals.com)
- **Strengths:** High domain authority, "Best Doctors" listicles rank well.
- **Weaknesses:** Generic "marketplace" feel, lacks deep procedure-specific content.

### 3. Yashoda Hospitals (yashodahospitals.com)
- **Strengths:** Detailed procedure pages, good "recovery" content.
- **Weaknesses:** Hospital brand dominates individual surgeon brand.

## Gap Analysis
- **Missing Topic:** "Degenerative Disc Disease" specific landing pages are rare. Most competitors bundle it under general "Back Pain" or "Slip Disc".
- **Opportunity:** A dedicated "Super Profile" for DDD with "Non-Surgical First" angle (Dr. Sayuj's USP) will capture specific long-tail intent.
