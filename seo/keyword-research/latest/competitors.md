## Competitor Analysis (Simulated) - 2026-01-03

### Target Keywords:
- "osteoporotic spine fracture treatment hyderabad"
- "spinal tuberculosis treatment hyderabad"
- "cervical spondylosis treatment hyderabad"

### Top Competitors Analyzed:
1.  **Yashoda Hospitals:** Strong presence for "spine surgery". Pages are content-heavy but often lack specific pricing transparency.
2.  **Apollo Hospitals:** Dominates "best neurosurgeon" queries. High authority, but generic procedure descriptions.
3.  **KIMS Hospitals:** Good location-based ranking.
4.  **Care Hospitals:** Strong on "symptoms" and "conditions".
5.  **Dr. Raveesh:** Direct competitor. Personal branding is strong.
6.  **SpineSurgeon.in:** SEO-focused niche site.

### Findings:
*   **Gap identified:** "Osteoporotic Spine Fracture" (Vertebroplasty/Kyphoplasty) is under-served. Most competitors bundle it under general "back pain" or "spine surgery" without specific pages for the elderly demographic who search for "fracture".
*   **Gap identified:** "Spinal Tuberculosis" (Pott's Spine) is a common Indian condition often missing a dedicated landing page on private surgeon sites, despite high search volume for "tb spine treatment".
*   **Content Opportunity:** Competitors have generic "Spondylosis" pages. We can differentiate by splitting into "Cervical" vs "Lumbar" and focusing on "Non-surgical" vs "Surgical" options explicitly.

### Strategy:
1.  **Create:** New condition page for `Osteoporotic Spine Fracture` targeting elderly patients and their children.
2.  **Create:** New condition page for `Spinal Tuberculosis` to capture specific medical intent.
3.  **Update:** Ensure existing Spondylosis coverage is robust (existing pages seem to exist or can be future work).
