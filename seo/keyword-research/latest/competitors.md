# Competitor Analysis - 2026-01-03

## Top Local Competitors (Hyderabad)
1. **Dr. Raveesh (drraveesh.com)**
   - Strong on "spine surgeon hyderabad".
   - Content: Good detail on procedures, but lacks cost transparency.
   - Gap: No dedicated "awake spine surgery" page.

2. **Yashoda Hospitals (yashodahospitals.com)**
   - Domain Authority powerhouse.
   - Weakness: Generic content, not surgeon-specific persona.

3. **Spine Surgeon India (spinesurgeon.in)**
   - Dr. Sukumar Sura.
   - Focuses heavily on endoscopic but site speed is lower.

## National / Portals
1. **Practo / Lybrate**
   - Dominates "best neurosurgeon" lists.
   - Strategy: We cannot beat them on lists, but can beat them on "procedure details" and "cost" queries.

## Content Gaps Identified
1. **Lumbar Laminectomy**: High volume "decompression" queries but no dedicated service page on our site (despite being in registry).
2. **Spondylolisthesis**: "Slipped vertebrae" is a common layman search. We have no condition page.
3. **Cost Queries**: Competitors hide costs. We should double down on `slip-disc-surgery-cost-hyderabad` (update it) or create new cost pages.
