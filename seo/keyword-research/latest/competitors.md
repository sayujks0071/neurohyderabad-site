## Primary Competitors (Local Surgeons)
1. **Dr. Sukumar Sura** (Yashoda) - Strong on "minimally invasive".
2. **Dr. G. V. Subbaiah Chowdhary** (Star) - High authority.
3. **Dr. Ranganathan** (Apollo) - Scoliosis focus.

## Secondary Competitors (Hospitals)
1. **Yashoda Hospitals** - Dominates "best hospital" queries.
2. **KIMS Hospitals** - Strong specific procedure pages.
3. **Apollo Health City** - High domain authority.

## SERP Observations
- "Lumbar Disc Replacement" results are dominated by national portals (Practo) and Apollo. Local surgeon pages are scarce. **Opportunity.**
- "Ankylosing Spondylitis" is mostly informational (Healthline, Mayo Clinic). Local treatment pages are missing.
