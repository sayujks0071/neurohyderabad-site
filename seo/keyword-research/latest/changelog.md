## Changelog - 2026-01-03

### New Research:
*   Simulated competitor analysis for Hyderabad Spine/Neuro market.
*   Identified 2 critical content gaps: `Osteoporotic Spine Fracture` and `Spinal Tuberculosis`.
*   Verified existing high-volume keywords like "Endoscopic Spine Surgery" and "Sciatica" are well-mapped.

### Actions:
1.  **Created:** `seo/keyword-research/2026-01-03/` artifacts.
2.  **Updated:** Central `seo/keyword-registry.json` and `seo/page-keyword-map.json` with new clusters.
3.  **Planned:** Creation of `/conditions/osteoporotic-spine-fracture-hyderabad/page.tsx` and `/conditions/spinal-tuberculosis-treatment-hyderabad/page.tsx` (or one of them if limit is tight).

### Notes:
*   "Spinal Stenosis" page was originally thought to be missing, but `lumbar canal stenosis` is mapped to `/conditions/spinal-stenosis-treatment-hyderabad`. Need to double check if that file *actually* exists. (Verified: It does NOT exist in the file list I pulled earlier. I only saw `spondylolisthesis` and `slip-disc` in `app/conditions/`).
*   **Correction:** I will prioritize `Spinal Stenosis` as it's a higher volume term than TB or Fracture.
*   **Revised Plan:** Create `Spinal Stenosis` and `Osteoporotic Fracture` pages. TB can wait for tomorrow.
