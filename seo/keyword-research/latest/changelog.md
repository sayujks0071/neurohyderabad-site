   - Targets: Spinal TB, Pott's Spine
   - Rationale: High prevalence in India, requires specialized neurosurgical input for spinal stability.
2. **/conditions/lumbar-spondylosis-treatment-hyderabad**
   - Targets: Age-related spinal degeneration
   - Rationale: Extremely common query. Currently might be hitting generic "back pain" pages or blogs. Needs a commercial landing page.
