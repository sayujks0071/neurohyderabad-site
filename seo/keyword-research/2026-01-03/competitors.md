# Competitor Analysis - 2026-01-03

## Competitors Analyzed

### 1. Surgeons
*   **Dr. Raveesh Sunkara (drraveesh.com):** Strong on "endoscopic spine surgery" and "best spine surgeon". Uses location pages well.
*   **Dr. Surya Prakash (spinesurgeon.in):** Ranks for "micro lumbar disc surgeries" and specific conditions. Older site design but good content depth.
*   **Dr. Ravi Suman Reddy:** Strong on "neurosurgeon hyderabad".
*   **Dr. Suresh Cheekatla:** "Best spine surgeon" contender.

### 2. Hospitals
*   **Yashoda Hospitals:** Dominates "cost" queries and general "best hospital" terms. Very high authority.
*   **Asian Spine Hospital:** Niche authority for "endoscopic".
*   **CARE Hospitals:** Good visibility for "spinal decompression".
*   **KIMS Hospitals:** Strong brand presence.

### 3. Portals / Aggregators
*   **Practo:** High visibility for "list of doctors" queries.
*   **Pristyn Care:** Aggressive on "cost" and "laser surgery" terms.
*   **Impact Guru / Lybrate:** Appear for cost estimates.

## Findings
*   **Cost Content Gap:** Competitors (hospitals & portals) rank for "cost" queries. Dr. Sayuj's site has a slip disc cost page, but could expand to "microdiscectomy cost" specifically or general "spine surgery cost".
*   **Comparison Content Gap:** "Laminectomy vs Microdiscectomy" is a common patient query (informational/commercial investigation) that is currently served by general health sites (Cleveland Clinic) or international sites. Localizing this (e.g., recovery in Indian context) is an opportunity.
*   **Local Intent:** "Hyderabad" modifier is essential. "Near me" is implied but "Hyderabad" is the explicit keyword used.
