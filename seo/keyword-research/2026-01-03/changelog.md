# Changelog - 2026-01-03

## Findings
- **Gap Identified:** "Sciatica Treatment" is a high-volume symptom query not explicitly targeted by a dedicated page (currently aggregated under slip disc).
- **Gap Identified:** "Spinal Fusion" / "Fixation" is a procedure gap. Competitors like Dr. Ravi Suman Reddy target this.
- **Competitor Move:** Germanten Hospital is ranking for "Disc Replacement".

## Actions
1. **New Page:** Creating `/conditions/sciatica-pain-treatment-hyderabad` to capture symptom-specific BOFU traffic.
2. **New Page:** Creating `/services/spinal-fusion-surgery-hyderabad` to capture procedure-specific BOFU traffic.
3. **Registry Update:** Added new keywords and mappings.
