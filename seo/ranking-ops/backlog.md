# SEO Backlog

## Opportunities Identified
- [ ] **Content Gap:** Create a dedicated "Cost of Spine Surgery" page or enhance existing service pages with more concrete insurance/package details (Competitor: Dr. Raveesh).
- [ ] **Schema:** Audit FAQSchema on all service pages.
- [ ] **Performance:** Check LCP on mobile for `spine-surgery` page.
- [ ] **Structure:** Check for other orphan pages in `sitemap.ts` that might be duplicates.
- [ ] **Local SEO:** Enhance "Areas We Serve" section on location pages with specific landmarks.
- [ ] **Internal Linking:** Add links from "Condition" pages (e.g., Sciatica) to the new "Spine Surgery" FAQs.
- [ ] **Multimedia:** Add `VideoObject` schema to Brain Surgery page if we can source or create an explainer video (Competitor Gap).
- [ ] **Content:** Expand "Patient Journey" section on Brain Surgery page to match competitor depth.
- [Content] Add specific cost guide for Brain Tumor Surgery (similar to Spine).
- [ ] **Audit:** Check all "Patient Education Resources" sections on other Condition pages for broken links or missing content.
- [ ] **Multimedia:** Add embedded video testimonials/explainers to Service pages (Competitor Advantage).

## 2026-01-26
- **Content Gap:** "Risks & Safety Protocols" section for Endoscopic Spine Surgery. Competitors list specific risks (dural tear, infection) to build trust.
- **Content Gap:** "Patient Education Video" embed. A 30-second animated explainer of the "Keyhole" vs "Open" difference.
- **Content Gap:** "Anesthesia Protocol" dedicated page. "Awake vs Asleep" is a big patient concern.

## 2025-02-23 Discovery
- **Duplicate Content Risk:** `app/services/minimally-invasive-spine-surgery/page.tsx` and `app/services/endoscopic-spine-surgery-hyderabad/page.tsx` target very similar keywords. Consider consolidating or distinctly canonicalizing one to the other.
- **Orphan Pages:** Sitemap discovery revealed several location pages (e.g., `/locations/neurosurgeon-near-jubilee-hills`) labeled as orphans. Need to link them from the footer or a dedicated Locations hub.
- **Video Sitemap:** We are generating it, but need to ensure all new patient stories are included.
