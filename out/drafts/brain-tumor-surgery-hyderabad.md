## Understanding brain tumours
Brain tumours range from benign meningiomas to aggressive glioblastomas. Surgery is often the first-line treatment to relieve pressure, obtain a diagnosis, and improve survival. Decisions depend on tumour type, size, location, and patient health. Dr. Sayuj Krishnan provides individualised recommendations after multidisciplinary review.

### When surgery is considered
- Tumours causing neurological symptoms (headache, weakness, seizures).
- Lesions showing growth on serial imaging.
- Tumours with mass effect or obstructive hydrocephalus.
- Cases requiring tissue diagnosis to guide oncology care.

## Diagnostic and planning workflow
1. **Neurological evaluation** — symptom mapping, cranial nerve assessment.
2. **MRI brain with contrast** — anatomical detail; add functional MRI (fMRI) or DTI for eloquent areas.
3. **MR spectroscopy / PET-CT** — selected cases to differentiate tumour grade.
4. **Pre-operative consultation** — discuss goals, risks, recovery, and rehabilitation.
5. **Tumour board** — review with oncology, radiology, pathology to finalise roadmap.

## Surgical approaches offered

### Microsurgical resection
- Standard approach for accessible tumours.
- Uses high-powered microscopes, neuronavigation, and neuromonitoring.
- Awake craniotomy offered when tumours lie near speech or motor cortex to preserve function.

### Endoscopic or keyhole techniques
- Ideal for ventricular tumours, pituitary adenomas, or select meningiomas.
- Smaller incisions, reduced bone removal, quicker recovery.

### Stereotactic biopsy
- Minimally invasive sampling when open surgery is high risk or diagnosis uncertain.
- Guides targeted therapy or clinical trials.

### Radiosurgery (Gamma Knife / LINAC)
- Non-invasive option for small benign tumours or residual disease.
- Often combined with surgery to consolidate control.

### Combined therapy planning
- Close coordination with medical and radiation oncology ensures seamless transition to adjuvant treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted agents).

## Safety measures in theatre
- Intraoperative neuromonitoring tracks motor, sensory, and cranial nerve function.
- 3D navigation ensures precise localisation and minimises retraction.
- Haemostasis techniques reduce blood loss; neuro-anaesthesia team handles complex cases.
- Dedicated MRI/CT access post-operatively for early assessment.

---

## Recovery expectations
- **Hospital stay**: Typically 3–5 days for supratentorial tumours; longer if ICU support required.
- **Rehabilitation**: Early physiotherapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy support.
- **Follow-up**: MRI at 48 hours, then at 3 months, adjusted per histology.
- **Return to work**: Desk roles in 4–6 weeks; manual labour requires longer evaluation.
- Long-term surveillance planned with oncology team; survivorship programme available.

---

## Comprehensive support services
- **Tumour board reviews** for complex and recurrent tumours.
- **Neuro-oncology liaison** to discuss chemotherapy or targeted agents.
- **Psychological counselling** for patients and caregivers.
- **Financial and insurance support** via hospital desk.

---

## When to seek urgent care
- Sudden severe headache with vomiting.
- New-onset seizures.
- Loss of consciousness, speech trouble, or limb weakness.
- Worsening vision or double vision.

Immediate emergency evaluation ensures life-saving intervention when raised intracranial pressure develops.

## Frequently asked questions
**Is brain tumour surgery always necessary?**  
Not always. Some benign or asymptomatic tumours can be observed. Surgery is recommended when benefits outweigh risks, and the multidisciplinary team helps decide.

**Will I need radiation after surgery?**  
Depends on tumour type and resection extent. High-grade gliomas usually need chemoradiation. Benign tumours may not require additional therapy if fully excised.

**How safe is awake craniotomy?**  
Awake craniotomy is carefully planned with anaesthesia and neuropsychology teams. It helps preserve speech and motor function; patients receive detailed preparation.

**What are the risks of brain surgery?**  
Risks include infection, bleeding, stroke, seizures, or neurologic deficits. Advanced monitoring and meticulous technique reduce these risks.

**How soon can I go home?**  
Most patients discharge within 3–5 days if neurologically stable. Some require longer ICU or rehab stays based on tumour location and health status.

**Do you offer second opinions?**  
Yes. Send existing imaging and reports; we provide teleconsults and in-person evaluations to confirm or refine treatment plans.
