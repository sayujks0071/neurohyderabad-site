# Signs of a Brain Tumor — What to Watch For

Persistent neurological symptoms deserve professional assessment. This guide helps you recognise warning signs and understand how Dr. Sayuj Krishnan and the Yashoda Hospital team approach diagnosis in Hyderabad.

## Why early recognition matters
Brain tumours can be benign or malignant, but all can disrupt critical brain functions if untreated. Early neurosurgical evaluation allows timely imaging, reduces emergency presentations, and improves the success of treatment. While most headaches are not tumours, certain patterns and accompanying symptoms require urgent attention.

## Common signs and symptoms

### Headache patterns
- Persistent headaches that are worse in the morning or with bending/coughing.
- Headaches that wake you from sleep.
- Headaches accompanied by vomiting or blurred vision.

### Seizures
- New-onset seizures in adults, even a single episode, warrant imaging.
- Focal seizures causing jerking of a limb, facial twitching, or speech arrest.

### Vision and speech changes
- Double vision, blurred vision, or loss of peripheral vision.
- Difficulty finding words, slurred speech, or changes in comprehension.

### Motor and balance problems
- Weakness or numbness on one side of the body.
- Difficulty with coordination, walking, or fine motor tasks.

### Cognitive or personality shifts
- Memory lapses, confusion, or slowed thinking.
- Noticeable changes in personality, mood, or behaviour experienced by family members.

### Hormonal or systemic effects
- Pituitary tumours may cause menstrual irregularities, unexplained weight changes, or hormonal imbalance.

## Emergency red flags
Seek immediate emergency care (nearest emergency department) if you experience:
- Sudden severe “worst-ever” headache.
- Loss of consciousness or repeated vomiting.
- New neurological deficits (weakness, speech loss, vision loss).
- Seizures lasting more than 5 minutes or repeated seizures without recovery.

## How diagnosis works in our clinic
1. **Comprehensive history and neurological examination** to map symptom patterns.
2. **MRI brain with contrast** as first-line imaging; CT head if MRI contraindicated.
3. **Advanced imaging** (functional MRI, MR spectroscopy, DTI) when tumours lie near critical brain regions.
4. **Laboratory and endocrine panels** if pituitary or systemic effects suspected.
5. **Multidisciplinary review** to interpret findings and advise next steps.

We coordinate imaging quickly and share reports digitally so caregivers can review them before the consultation.

## What to expect after imaging
- If a mass is detected, Dr. Sayuj Krishnan outlines surgical, radiosurgical, and adjunct treatment options.
- Benign findings (e.g., migraine) lead to referral back to neurology or pain specialists with a management plan.
- Ambiguous lesions may require surveillance imaging or stereotactic biopsy.

## Support for patients and families
- Nurse navigators assist with scheduling, financial counselling, and rehabilitation planning.
- Psych-oncology services help families cope with anxiety around diagnosis.
- Teleconsult slots available for outstation patients requiring follow-up discussions.

## Frequently asked questions
**Are all persistent headaches caused by tumours?**  
No. Most headaches are related to migraine, tension, or sinus issues. However, headaches with neurological symptoms or progressive patterns need evaluation.

**When should I get an MRI?**  
If headaches are worsening, accompanied by seizures, vision changes, or neurological deficits, an MRI is recommended. Your neurosurgeon will advise the right protocol.

**Can a brain tumour cause memory problems?**  
Yes. Tumours in frontal or temporal lobes can affect memory, behaviour, or executive function. Early assessment can prevent further decline.

**Do brain tumour symptoms appear suddenly?**  
Some do, particularly bleeding tumours or those causing hydrocephalus. Many grow slowly with subtle symptoms, so regular monitoring is important when warning signs appear.

**Should I see a neurosurgeon or neurologist first?**  
If imaging already suggests a tumour, schedule directly with a neurosurgeon. For undiagnosed symptoms, either specialist can initiate evaluation; neurosurgical teams coordinate imaging and treatment quickly.

**Can lifestyle changes reverse symptoms?**  
Lifestyle support (sleep, ergonomics, nutrition) aids recovery but does not treat tumours. Medical assessment is essential for a definitive plan.
