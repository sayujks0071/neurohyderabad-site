# Cervical Radiculopathy Treatment in Hyderabad

Cervical radiculopathy occurs when nerves in the neck become compressed, causing pain, tingling, or weakness radiating into the shoulder, arm, or hand. Dr. Sayuj Krishnan offers comprehensive evaluation and minimally invasive solutions tailored to working professionals and active adults in Hyderabad.

- Conservative-first approach: physiotherapy, posture correction, and medication where effective.
- Advanced imaging and neurodiagnostics to pinpoint the affected nerve root.
- Minimally invasive and motion-preserving procedures prioritised before fusion.
- Rehabilitation pathways designed to restore strength and prevent recurrence.

## Symptoms to watch for
- Neck pain radiating into the shoulder blades or down the arm.
- Numbness, tingling, or “pins and needles” in the fingers.
- Weak grip or difficulty lifting objects.
- Pain aggravated by neck extension or rotation.
- Headaches originating in the neck (cervicogenic headache).
- Loss of coordination or balance in severe cases.

Seek urgent evaluation if you experience sudden weakness, loss of bowel/bladder control, or difficulty walking — these can signal spinal cord compression.

## Common causes
- Degenerative cervical disc disease causing herniation or bone spurs.
- Foraminal stenosis narrowing nerve exit points.
- Postural strain (“tech neck”) leading to chronic inflammation.
- Traumatic injury (whiplash, sports).
- Less commonly: tumours, infections, or congenital abnormalities.

## Diagnostic pathway at Yashoda Hospital, Malakpet
1. **Clinical examination** — Spurling test, reflexes, strength grading.
2. **MRI cervical spine** — Identifies disc herniations, stenosis, cord compression.
3. **Nerve conduction studies / EMG** — Useful when symptoms overlap with peripheral neuropathy.
4. **X-ray with flexion/extension views** — Assess instability if surgery is considered.
5. **Pain specialist review** — Collaborative approach for injection planning or conservative care.

## Treatment options

### Conservative management (first-line)
- Physiotherapy emphasising cervical stabilisation, scapular strengthening, and posture.
- Anti-inflammatory medication, short courses of neuropathic pain agents (gabapentin, pregabalin).
- Ergonomic adjustments (monitor height, chair support, frequent breaks).
- Cervical collar usage in acute phases only (short duration).

### Image-guided injections
- Selective nerve root blocks or epidural steroid injections provide diagnostic and therapeutic relief.
- Ideal for patients needing pain control while physiotherapy progresses.

### Minimally invasive decompression
- **Endoscopic foraminotomy**: Removes bone spurs/disc fragments through 8 mm incision, preserving motion.
- **Ultrasonic laminoforaminotomy (ULBD)**: For bilateral stenosis with minimal muscle disruption.
- Day-care or overnight stay; return to desk job in 1–2 weeks.

### Fusion or disc replacement
- **Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF)** for instability or recurrent herniation.
- **Cervical arthroplasty (disc replacement)** for motion preservation in selected patients.
- Navigation and neuromonitoring enhance safety; typical stay 2–3 days.

### Post-operative rehabilitation
- Structured physiotherapy starts within days.
- Gradual return to activity; lifting limits updated at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
- Ergonomic coaching to prevent recurrence.

## Living well during recovery
- Maintain neutral neck posture at work; set screen at eye level.
- Take microbreaks every 45 minutes to stretch.
- Practise scapular retraction and chin-tuck exercises as advised.
- Sleep with cervical-support pillow; avoid stomach sleeping.
- Manage stress to reduce muscle tension.

## Frequently asked questions
**Does every cervical radiculopathy need surgery?**  
No. Up to 80% improve with conservative management. Surgery is recommended when pain persists, weakness develops, or imaging shows severe compression.

**How soon will I recover after endoscopic foraminotomy?**  
Most patients return to light duties within 1–2 weeks and resume full activity by 6 weeks, depending on job demands.

**Is fusion always permanent?**  
Yes, ACDF permanently fuses the treated level. It may be necessary when instability or severe degeneration exists. Motion-preserving options are considered when feasible.

**Will physiotherapy alone cure my symptoms?**  
Physiotherapy alleviates many cases, especially posture-driven radiculopathy. It is also essential after surgery to maintain strength and prevent recurrence.

**What are the risks of surgery?**  
Risks include infection, bleeding, nerve injury, hoarseness, or swallowing difficulty (usually temporary). Choosing an experienced surgeon reduces complications.

**Can cervical issues cause headaches?**  
Yes. Cervicogenic headaches and occipital neuralgia can stem from cervical nerve compression. Addressing the root cause alleviates head pain.
