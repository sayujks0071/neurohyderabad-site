# Pain on Top of the Head — Causes & Care Pathway

Vertex headaches (pain on the crown or top of the head) often stem from posture, muscle tension, or migraine. Sometimes they signal nerve compression or vascular issues needing specialist review. This guide explains common causes, red flags, and how Dr. Sayuj Krishnan supports patients in Hyderabad.

## Common causes of vertex head pain

### Tension-type headache
- Triggered by long hours at a desk, stress, eye strain, or dehydration.
- Presents as a tight band or pressure around the scalp.
- Often improves with rest, hydration, stretching, or over-the-counter analgesics.

### Migraine
- Moderate to severe throbbing pain; may shift to the top of the head.
- Frequently accompanied by nausea, light sensitivity, or aura.
- Managed with acute migraine medication and lifestyle adjustments.

### Poor posture & muscle imbalance
- Rounded shoulders and forward head posture strain upper cervical muscles.
- Common among IT professionals and students; often called “tech neck”.
- Physiotherapy, ergonomic changes, and strengthening bring relief.

### Cervicogenic headache
- Pain begins in the neck and radiates to the scalp due to cervical facet or disc pathology.
- Worsens with neck movement; may be linked to cervical radiculopathy.
- Requires cervical spine assessment and targeted therapy.

### Occipital neuralgia
- Irritation of occipital nerves causes stabbing or burning pain radiating to the vertex.
- Can result from muscle spasm, nerve entrapment, or post-whiplash changes.
- Responds to nerve blocks, medications, or minimally invasive decompression.

## Red flags — when to seek urgent care
- Sudden “thunderclap” headache (seek emergency evaluation to rule out bleeding).
- Headache with fever, neck stiffness, or rash (possible infection).
- Neurological symptoms: weakness, vision changes, speech difficulty, confusion.
- Pain after head injury with drowsiness or vomiting.
- Progressive headaches in patients over 50 with systemic symptoms.

If any red flag appears, visit the nearest emergency department or call local medical services immediately.

## Diagnostic approach at our clinic
1. **Detailed history** — onset, duration, triggers, associated symptoms, lifestyle.
2. **Neurological and cervical spine examination** — posture, range of motion, nerve function.
3. **Imaging**:
   - MRI brain or CT head if red flags, neurological deficits, or suspected structural lesions.
   - MRI cervical spine when cervical radiculopathy suspected.
4. **Ancillary tests** — blood pressure, blood tests, or eye exam when indicated.
5. **Multidisciplinary review** — physiotherapy, pain medicine, or neurology referrals as needed.

## Treatment pathways
- **Lifestyle optimisation**: ergonomic assessment, posture correction, hydration, sleep hygiene.
- **Physiotherapy & manual therapy**: targeted exercises for cervical stability and scapular strength.
- **Medication management**: tailored plans for migraine prophylaxis or acute relief.
- **Nerve blocks or radiofrequency ablation**: for occipital neuralgia or refractory cervicogenic headaches.
- **Minimally invasive spine procedures**: endoscopic foraminotomy or decompression when cervical nerve compression is confirmed.
- **Stress reduction**: relaxation techniques, yoga, mindfulness, or counselling.

Each plan is customised; surgical intervention is considered only after conservative measures fail or when imaging shows clear compression requiring decompression.

## Living with recurrent vertex headaches
- Maintain a headache diary noting triggers, food intake, sleep, and stress levels.
- Take regular microbreaks during desk work; follow 20-20-20 rule for screens.
- Adjust workstation (chair height, monitor level, lumbar support).
- Stay hydrated and maintain balanced nutrition to avoid hypoglycaemia-induced headaches.
- Engage in regular physical activity focusing on neck and core stability.

## When to see Dr. Sayuj Krishnan
- Chronic head pain alongside neck/arm symptoms (numbness, tingling, weakness).
- Suspected cervical radiculopathy or spinal stenosis contributing to headaches.
- Occipital neuralgia not responding to medication.
- Need for a second opinion on imaging that shows cervical disc issues or brain lesions.

At Room 317, OPD Block, Yashoda Hospital, Malakpet, the team coordinates imaging, physiotherapy, and neurosurgical intervention where indicated.

## Frequently asked questions
**Is pain on top of the head always serious?**  
Not always. Most cases relate to tension or posture. However, persistent or severe pain, especially with neurological symptoms, needs medical evaluation.

**Can cervical spine problems cause vertex headaches?**  
Yes. Cervical radiculopathy and facet joint issues often refer pain to the top of the head. Imaging and physical examination confirm the cause.

**Do I need an MRI immediately?**  
Not for every headache. MRI is recommended when red flags exist, symptoms persist despite conservative care, or neurological signs appear.

**What home remedies help?**  
Good posture, ergonomic adjustments, hydration, stretching, and adequate sleep help. Persistent pain still warrants clinical review.

**Are nerve blocks safe?**  
Occipital nerve blocks are minimally invasive and safe when performed by experienced specialists. They offer both diagnostic and therapeutic benefits.

**Can surgery cure my headaches?**  
Only headaches caused by nerve compression or structural issues respond to surgery. Most patients improve with non-surgical care and lifestyle adjustments.
