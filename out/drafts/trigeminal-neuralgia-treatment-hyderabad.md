## Understanding trigeminal neuralgia
Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic pain disorder involving the fifth cranial nerve. Patients describe sudden, electric shock–like pain on one side of the face lasting seconds to minutes. Attacks may cluster and can be triggered by everyday activities such as brushing teeth or speaking. Classical TN usually arises from a blood vessel compressing the nerve at the brainstem. Secondary TN may follow multiple sclerosis, tumours, or facial trauma, requiring detailed evaluation.

Early neurosurgical consultation helps differentiate classical TN from look-alikes (atypical facial pain, cluster headache, sinus or dental causes) and ensures the right imaging pathway.

## Common symptoms and triggers
- Short bursts of sharp, stabbing, or shock-like facial pain.
- Pain typically affecting cheek, jaw, or gums on one side; occasionally the forehead.
- Triggered by light touch, chewing, shaving, talking, brushing teeth, or cold wind.
- Periods of remission may occur before pain returns with greater intensity.
- Some patients experience dull background aches between attacks (mixed TN).

Seek urgent care if facial pain is accompanied by persistent numbness, weakness, or double vision — these can point to secondary causes.

## How we diagnose TN in Hyderabad
1. **Clinical history and neurological examination** — character, duration, triggers, neurological deficits.
2. **High-resolution MRI with CISS/FIESTA sequences** — visualise vascular compression, demyelinating plaques, or tumours.
3. **MR angiography / CT angiography** — map arterial or venous loops around the nerve.
4. **Dental / ENT evaluation** — rule out peripheral causes when indicated.
5. **Blood tests** — baseline before initiating anticonvulsant medication.

Our team reviews images in a dedicated facial pain board so both medical and surgical options are offered with transparency.

## Treatment pathways

### 1. Medication (first-line)
- Carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine remains the initial therapy.
- Alternatives include gabapentin, baclofen, or lamotrigine.
- Regular monitoring for side effects (hyponatraemia, liver enzymes, blood counts).
- Escalate to procedural options if pain persists, medications are intolerable, or high doses cause sedation.

### 2. Microvascular Decompression (MVD)
- Microsurgical procedure repositioning the offending vessel away from the nerve with a Teflon pad.
- Offers the highest chance of long-term pain freedom (70–80% at 10 years in experienced hands).
- Performed under general anaesthesia; typical hospital stay 2–3 days.
- Intraoperative neuromonitoring and neuronavigation minimise risks.

### 3. Gamma Knife / Stereotactic Radiosurgery
- Outpatient procedure delivering focused radiation to the trigeminal root entry zone.
- Suited for older patients, those with comorbidities, or anyone preferring non-open surgery.
- Pain relief usually develops over 2–8 weeks; numbness risk kept low with precise dosing.

### 4. Percutaneous procedures
- **Balloon compression** — mechanical pressure on the nerve ganglion.
- **Radiofrequency rhizotomy** — selective lesioning of pain fibres.
- **Glycerol rhizolysis** — chemical lesioning for recurrent cases.
- Typically day-care procedures with rapid recovery; may suit patients who need immediate relief or have recurrent TN post-MVD.

### 5. Addressing secondary TN
- If imaging shows a tumour, aneurysm, or multiple sclerosis plaque, treatment plans align with the underlying cause (e.g., tumour resection, demyelinating therapy).

## Recovery and follow-up
- **After MVD**: ICU monitoring for 24 hours, discharge by day 3; return to desk work ~2 weeks; avoid heavy lifting for 4 weeks.
- **After radiosurgery**: resume routine the same day; follow-up at 6 weeks and 3 months for pain response.
- **After percutaneous procedures**: same-day discharge; transient facial numbness expected; follow-up within 7 days.
- Regular reviews allow medication tapering once sustained relief is confirmed.

---

## When to consult urgently
- Severe facial pain despite maximum medication.
- Medication side effects (drowsiness, imbalance, allergic rashes).
- Facial numbness, double vision, or weakness.
- Pain patterns changing sides or becoming constant.

Timely evaluation prevents deterioration in quality of life and allows planning for definitive procedures before pain sensitises the nervous system.

## Frequently asked questions
**Is trigeminal neuralgia curable?**  
Many patients achieve long-term pain relief, especially after MVD. Recurrence risk depends on nerve anatomy and adherence to follow-up.

**How do I know if I’m a candidate for MVD?**  
Candidates have classical TN with vascular compression on MRI, are medically fit for anaesthesia, and prefer a durable solution over medication reliance.

**How long before radiosurgery works?**  
Most patients notice improvement within 2–8 weeks post-procedure. Medication tapering begins once consistent relief is achieved.

**Will I get numbness after treatment?**  
Modern techniques aim to preserve normal sensation. Minor numbness can occur, especially after percutaneous procedures, and usually settles.

**Can TN recur?**  
Yes, recurrence can happen months or years later. Options remain available; repeat MVD or radiosurgery can still be considered.

**Is trigeminal neuralgia linked to multiple sclerosis?**  
Up to 2–5% of TN cases relate to MS. Imaging and neurological exam help identify demyelinating plaques, guiding medical management.
