# Competitor Gap Analysis: Hyderabad Neuro/Spine

## Competitors Analyzed
- **Yashoda Hospitals:** High domain authority, extensive pages, strong backlinks.
- **KIMS Hospitals:** Strong local presence, good physician profiles.
- **Apollo Hospitals:** Massive health library, high trust.
- **Dr. Raveesh:** Direct competitor, strong local SEO.

## Content Gaps Identified

### 1. Recovery Timelines & Visual Ladders
**Competitor Status:** Most competitors use generic text like "recovery takes 2-4 weeks".
**Our Status:** We have some blog posts (e.g., `endoscopic-spine-surgery-recovery-timeline`) but service pages lack visual "Return to Work" timelines.
**Opportunity:** Embed visual recovery timelines directly on Service/Condition pages (e.g., Day 1: Walk, Day 2: Discharge, Day 14: Work).

### 2. Cost Transparency
**Competitor Status:** Almost no competitor lists prices or insurance specifics openly.
**Our Status:** We have `cost-of-*` blog posts.
**Opportunity:** Add a "Cost Transparency" section to Service pages with "Insurance Accepted", "Cashless Options", and "Estimated Price Range" (if compliant) schema.

### 3. Local Intent Optimization
**Competitor Status:** Competitors rank for "Neurosurgeon Hyderabad".
**Our Status:** We have location pages (`/locations/banjara-hills`), but they need stronger interlinking and "Near Me" content.
**Opportunity:** Create "Second Opinion" landing pages or sections targeting patients who visited competitors (e.g., "Looking for a second opinion after visiting Yashoda?").

### 4. Video Integration
**Competitor Status:** Some use YouTube embeds.
**Our Status:** We have `sitemap-videos.xml` and Remotion capabilities.
**Opportunity:** Deploy short "Doctor Explains" video snippets on top of key service pages (Awake Spine Surgery, etc.) using `VideoObject` schema.

## Keyword Gaps

| Keyword | Intent | Target Page |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| "endoscopic spine surgery cost hyderabad" | Commercial | `/services/endoscopic-spine-surgery-hyderabad` (Add Cost Section) |
| "laser spine surgery hyderabad" | Informational/Comm | Blog or Service Section (Clarify Laser vs Endoscopic) |
| "best neurosurgeon for second opinion hyderabad" | Commercial | New Landing Page or Section |
| "sciatica treatment without surgery hyderabad" | Informational | `/conditions/sciatica-pain-treatment-hyderabad` |
| "spinal fusion success rate hyderabad" | Informational | Blog/Service Page |

## Schema Gaps
- **FAQPage:** Missing on many condition pages (e.g., `/conditions/chiari-malformation-hyderabad`).
- **MedicalWebPage:** Ensure `lastReviewed` matches `updatedOn`.
- **BreadcrumbList:** Needs validation on all deep pages.
