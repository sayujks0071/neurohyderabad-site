# Competitor Gap Analysis

## Benchmark: Dr. Raveesh Sunkara (drraveesh.com)
**Page Analyzed:** Endoscopic Spine Surgery in Hyderabad

### Strengths of Competitor:
1. **Explicit Cost Table:** detailed pricing table for various procedures (TESS, Interlaminar, etc.) with range (e.g., 2.0L - 3.5L INR).
2. **Success Rate Section:** Dedicated section citing percentages (80-90% for herniated disc).
3. **Procedure Steps:** Step-by-step breakdown of the surgery (Preparation -> Incision -> Endoscope -> Treatment).
4. **Blog Density:** Massive interlinking to related blogs in the footer/sidebar.

### Gaps in Dr. Sayuj's Site:
1. **Visual Cost Data:** While we have cost FAQs, we lack a structured comparison table which is a high-intent signal.
2. **Success Metrics:** We mention "80% same-day discharge" in Hero, but a dedicated "Outcomes & Success Rates" section on service pages would build more trust.
3. **Procedure Walkthrough:** We have `RecoveryTimeline`, but a "What happens during surgery" step-by-step visual/text would be beneficial.
4. **Video Content:** Competitor implies video/media. We have `RemotionVideoEmbedWrapper` which is a **Major Advantage** if working correctly.

### Recommendations:
1. **Add Cost Tables** to Service pages (especially `endoscopic-spine-surgery-hyderabad`).
2. **Enhance "Procedure" section** with step-by-step details.
3. **Leverage Video**: Ensure Remotion videos are prominent and working (they are lazy loaded, which is good for perf).
