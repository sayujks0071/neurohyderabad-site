## Structural Gaps
- **Title Tags:** Competitors use concise, punchy titles (e.g., "Best Neurosurgeon in Hyderabad - Apollo"). Dr. Sayuj's are often >60 chars and truncated.
- **Schema:** Competitors often use `MedicalSpecialty` and `Hospital` schema effectively. Dr. Sayuj has `Physician` but could enhance with `MedicalClinic` for specific locations (Yashoda Malakpet).
- **Video Content:** Competitors like AIG use video thumbnails in SERPs (when available). Dr. Sayuj has Remotion capabilities; leverage them for video schema on service pages.

## Recommendations
1. **Shorten Titles:** Bring primary keyword to the front, keep under 60 chars.
2. **Cost Content:** Add a "Cost of Surgery" section or FAQ to high-intent service pages.
3. **Local SEO:** Create/Optimize Google Business Profile posts mirroring the `/neurosurgeon-malakpet` content.
