# Competitor Benchmark: Hyderabad Spine/Neuro

## 1. Top Competitors (SERP Analysis)
Based on "spine surgeon hyderabad" and "minimally invasive spine surgery hyderabad":

1.  **Dr. Raveesh Sunkara (drraveesh.com)**
    *   **Strengths:** Strong "Best X in Hyderabad" pages, explicit "Endoscopic" and "Minimally Invasive" pages.
    *   **Gaps:** Some pages feel generic.
2.  **SpineSurgeon.in (Dr. Surya Prakash Voleti)**
    *   **Strengths:** Exact match domain, 25+ years experience highlighted.
    *   **Gaps:** Older design, potentially slower.
3.  **Yashoda Hospitals**
    *   **Strengths:** High domain authority, huge content volume, "List of Doctors" aggregator style.
    *   **Gaps:** Less personal connection than a solo surgeon site.

## 2. Content Gaps Identified
*   **"Day Care" / "Same Day" Messaging:** Competitors like Citi Neuro Centre emphasize "Faster Recovery" and "Day Care". Our site has some mention but needs a dedicated landing page or stronger H1 focus.
*   **Cost Transparency:** Users search for cost, but competitors often hide it. We have cost blogs, but they need to be more prominent or consolidated into a "Price Guide" to win the featured snippet.
*   **"Awake" Surgery:** Dr. Sayuj's "Awake Spine Surgery" is a unique differentiator. We need to double down on this vs general "Minimally Invasive".

## 3. Recommended Actions
1.  **Consolidate "Cost" content:** We have multiple cost blogs. Create a "Master Cost Guide" page or ensure the main cost blog is updated and linked everywhere.
2.  **Boost "Awake" & "Endoscopic" keywords:** Ensure metadata explicitly targets "Endoscopic Spine Surgery Hyderabad" (which we do) but also "Day Care Spine Surgery".
3.  **Schema:** Ensure `Physician` schema is on ALL pages (currently missing on some per static audit).
