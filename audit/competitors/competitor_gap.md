# Competitor Benchmark: Hyderabad Neuro/Spine

## Target Queries
1. endoscopic spine surgery hyderabad
2. spine surgeon hyderabad
3. neurosurgeon hyderabad
4. slipped disc surgery hyderabad
5. minimally invasive spine surgery hyderabad

## Competitor Themes Observed in SERP
- Most top-ranking sites (e.g., Yashoda, Apollo, KIMS) utilize deep silo structures (`/specialties/neurosurgery/conditions/spine-surgery`).
- Local competitors aggressively implement `FAQPage` schema on localized pages.
- Strong reliance on "Best" prefixes for local intent (e.g., "Best Spine Surgeon in Hyderabad").

## Opportunities for Dr. Sayuj
1. Ensure explicit `FAQPage` schema is embedded dynamically on the Top 5 condition pages.
2. Ensure `MedicalClinic` schema links back to the primary `Physician` entity across all Location variants.
