    *   **Strengths:** Dominates SERPs for specific condition/treatment keywords (Sciatica, Endoscopic). Strong personal branding.
    *   **Content:** Dedicated pages for almost every condition. Good speed.
    *   **Gap:** Design is generic. Content depth varies.

    *   **Strengths:** Domain authority as a specialized hospital. "Full Endoscopic" branding.
    *   **Gap:** Corporate feel. Less personal connection.

3.  **Epione Pain & Spine (epionepainandspine.com)**
    *   **Strengths:** Aggressive "No Surgery" marketing. fast pages.
    *   **Gap:** Not neurosurgery focused.

4.  **Major Hospitals (Apollo, Yashoda, KIMS)**
    *   **Strengths:** massive DR.
    *   **Gap:** Page paths are deep (e.g., `apollohospitals.com/hyderabad/neuro/doctor`). Specific doctor pages are weak on content.

## Dr. Sayuj's Position
*   **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** German-trained (Authority), "Endoscopic Pioneer" (Niche), "Awake Brain Surgery" (Niche).
*   **Opportunity:** Beat hospitals on *depth* of content per page. Beat Dr. Raveesh on *Schema/Technical SEO* and *Visual Trust* (Dr. Sayuj's site design is superior).

## Strategy
1.  **Local Dominance:** Own "Malakpet", "Dilsukhnagar", "LB Nagar" keywords where Yashoda Malakpet is strong, but also target "Banjara Hills/Jubilee Hills" for premium patients.
2.  **Schema Wins:** Implement the missing `MedicalWebPage` schema on condition pages to get "Medical Reviewer" rich snippets which competitors might lack.
3.  **Video/Visual:** Leverage the video content (Doctor Intro, Testimonials) which is a strong differentiator against text-heavy competitor pages.
