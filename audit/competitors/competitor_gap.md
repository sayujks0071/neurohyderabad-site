# Competitor Analysis & Gap Report

## Top Competitors (Neurosurgeon / Spine Surgeon Hyderabad)

1.  **AIG Hospitals / Kamineni Hospitals / Apollo**: Big brand dominance. Hard to beat on domain authority alone.
2.  **Dr. Raveesh Sunkara (drraveesh.com)**: Direct individual competitor.
    - **Strengths**: Dedicated pages for specific procedures (Endoscopic Spine Surgery), "Cost details" in meta description (high CTR).
    - **Keywords**: "Best Neurosurgeon in Hyderabad", "Endoscopic Spine Surgery in Hyderabad".
3.  **Dr. Surya Prakash (spinesurgeon.in)**: Niche focus on spine.
    - **Strengths**: "International training", "Minimally invasive" focus.
4.  **Asian Spine Hospital**: Specialist hospital.
    - **Strengths**: "Full Endoscopic" branding.

## Content Gaps identified

1.  **Cost Transparency**: Competitors (Dr. Raveesh) explicitly mention "cost details" in snippets. Dr. Sayuj has cost blogs, but main service pages might lack this schema or explicit section in meta description.
2.  **"Full Endoscopic" vs "Minimally Invasive"**: Asian Spine Hospital uses "Full Endoscopic". Dr. Sayuj should ensure this specific terminology is prominent if applicable (he does use it).
3.  **Video/Testimonials**: Snippets for competitors often mention "Success stories" or "Reviews".
4.  **Schema Usage**: Hospitals use `MedicalClinic`. Dr. Sayuj uses `Physician` mostly. He needs to leverage `MedicalClinic` for his location pages effectively to compete with hospital local packs.
