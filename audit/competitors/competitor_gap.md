# Competitor Gap Analysis

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Focus:** Neurosurgery & Spine Surgery Hyderabad

## 1. Yashoda Hospitals (Institutional)
- **URL:** `https://www.yashodahospitals.com/specialities/neurosurgery/`
- **Gap:**
  - Their content is highly clinical and impersonal.
  - Lacks detailed "Dr. Sayuj" brand voice.
  - Misses specific "cost breakdown" and "insurance process" details which patients crave.
- **Action:** Create detailed "Cost of Spine Surgery in Hyderabad" guide with insurance checklists.

## 2. Practo / Lybrate (Aggregators)
- **URL:** `https://www.practo.com/hyderabad/neurosurgeon`
- **Gap:**
  - Generic lists, no depth on *why* a specific surgeon is better.
  - User intent is "find a doctor", but we can capture "is this surgery right for me?" intent better.
- **Action:** Optimize "Patient Stories" and "Outcome Data" to prove superiority over a generic list.

## 3. Local Specialists (Dr. [Competitor])
- **Gap:**
  - Often have poor mobile UX and slow sites.
  - Lack "Financial Transparency" pages.
- **Action:** Launch `spine-surgery-insurance-coverage-hyderabad` to win on trust.

## Summary of Opportunities
1.  **Financial Transparency:** Huge gap. Competitors hide costs; we should explain them (ranges, insurance).
2.  **Patient Journey:** Competitors talk about "procedure"; we should talk about "recovery timeline" and "life after surgery".
3.  **Video:** Leverage Remotion to dominate video results where competitors only have text.
