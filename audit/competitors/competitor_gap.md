## Gap Analysis by Page Type

### 1. Service Pages (e.g., Endoscopic Spine Surgery)

-   **Asian Spine:** Extremely detailed structure (Overview, Types, Procedure, Cost, Recovery, Success Rate). Uses tables for cost ranges and recovery timelines.
-   **Dr. Raveesh:** Personal tone ("Why Choose Dr. Raveesh"), extensive FAQs, and related blog posts linked at the bottom.

    -   Lack of specific **"Cost"** sections or tables (Competitors explicitly list cost ranges).
    -   Fewer **FAQs** on service pages compared to Dr. Raveesh.
    -   Need more explicit **"Recovery Timeline"** visualizations or lists.
    -   **Video integration** is better on competitor sites.

### 2. Condition Pages (e.g., Slipped Disc)
**Competitor Strengths:**
-   **Yashoda/Apollo:** High authority, medical definitions, symptom checkers.
-   **Dr. Raveesh:** Focuses on "Can it be cured permanently?" and "Surgery vs Non-Surgery".
-   **Gap for Dr. Sayuj:**
    -   Need to address **"Non-surgical options"** more prominently to build trust before pitching surgery.
    -   **"Red Flags"** sections (When to see a doctor immediately) are effective on competitor sites.

### 3. Blog Strategy
**Competitor Strengths:**
-   **Dr. Raveesh:** High frequency (daily/weekly), covers long-tail queries ("Can stress cause back pain?", "Office chair back pain").
-   **Gap for Dr. Sayuj:**
    -   Expand content on **lifestyle/prevention** topics (Ergonomics, Sleep, Diet).
    -   Target **"Cost"** and **"Insurance"** specific queries in blogs.
