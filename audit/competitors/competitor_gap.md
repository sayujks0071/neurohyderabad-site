## Feature Gaps
- **Interactive Cost Calculator:** Competitors have "Get Quote", but a simple calculator would be a differentiator.
- **Video Testimonials:** Dr. Sayuj has some, but competitors often have more polished video libraries.
- **Symptom Checker:** "Do I need surgery?" interactive tool.

## Strategic Recommendations
1. **Win on "Endoscopic":** Dominate the "Endoscopic" niche where corporate hospitals are more generic.
2. **Price Transparency:** Create a "Cost of Surgery" guide (with ranges) to capture high-intent traffic.
3. **Hyper-Local Pages:** Expand on location pages (e.g., "Neurosurgeon in Jubilee Hills") with specific local landmarks/directions.
