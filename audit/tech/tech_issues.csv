Issue,Severity,Evidence,Recommendation
"Sitemap Conflict: public/sitemap.xml shadows app/sitemap.ts",High,"Both files exist. Static file takes precedence, preventing dynamic updates.",Remove public/sitemap.xml or configure next-sitemap to strictly generate specialized sitemaps only.
"Robots.txt points to potentially missing sitemaps",Medium,"robots.ts lists sitemap-blog.xml etc. If these are dynamic routes, they work. If they are expected to be static files from next-sitemap, verify they exist.","Verify accessibility of all sitemaps in robots.txt."
"Long Titles",Medium,"Many pages have titles > 60 chars due to brand suffix.","Shorten base titles or reduce suffix length."
