    question: 'What is the difference between degenerative disc disease and normal aging?',
    answer: [
      'While some disc degeneration is expected with aging, degenerative disc disease (DDD) causes persistent pain, stiffness, and loss of function.',
      'With DDD, the disc loses water content, develops tears in the outer wall, and can irritate nearby nerves. Treatment focuses on pain relief, mobility, and preventing further degeneration.'

    question: 'Can degenerative disc disease be cured?',
    answer: [

    question: 'What is endoscopic discectomy and how effective is it?',

    question: 'What causes spinal stenosis and can it be prevented?',
    answer: [

    question: 'How is spinal stenosis diagnosed?',
