# Competitor Gap Scan

1. Scan the top 3 competitors (as defined in `AGENTS.md`) for new content published recently.
2. Compare with our current sitemap.
3. Identify "Content Gaps" – topics they cover that we do not.

**Action:**
- Create a list of missing topics.
- Prioritize them based on relevance to "Neurosurgeon in Hyderabad" and "Spine Surgery".
- If a high-priority gap is found, draft a plan or a new page to cover it.
