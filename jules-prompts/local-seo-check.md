# Local SEO Health Check

Verify the Local SEO signals for "Dr. Sayuj Krishnan".
1. Check `src/data/locations.ts` for accuracy.
2. Verify that NAP (Name, Address, Phone) is consistent across the site.
3. Check that the `LocalBusiness` or `Physician` schema is validating correctly (use the `json-ld-validator` workflow logic or scripts).

**Action:**
- Run `npm run check:schemas` to validate JSON-LD schema on key pages.
- Ensure the Google Maps embed is working and correct.
- If errors are found, fix them in a PR.
