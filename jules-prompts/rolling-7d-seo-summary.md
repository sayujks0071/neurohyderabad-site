# Rolling 7-Day SEO Summary

Analyze the SEO performance for the last 7 days.
*Note: Since you might not have direct access to GSC/GA, use available local reports or verify technical SEO health.*

1. Run `pnpm run build` to check for build errors.
2. Run `npm run seo:audit` to check for technical SEO issues.
3. Check `seo/keyword-research/latest/` for any manual updates.

**Action:**
- Summarize the technical health of the repo.
- Report any broken links (run broken link checker if possible).
- Identify any "quick wins" for the next week.
