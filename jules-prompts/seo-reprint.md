# SEO Reprint Task

Analyze the current blog posts and service pages. Identify content that is:
1. Outdated (older than 6 months).
2. Underperforming (low traffic/impressions based on available data).
3. Missing recent keywords found in `seo/keyword-registry.json`.

**Action:**
- Select one page to "reprint" (update/refresh).
- Analyze the top 3 competitors for its main keyword to understand current User Intent.
- Rewrite or improve the content to match or exceed competitor quality (E-E-A-T).
- Submit a PR with the updated content.
