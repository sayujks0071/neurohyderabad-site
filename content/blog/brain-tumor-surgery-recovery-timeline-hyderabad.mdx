  - question: "When can I wash my hair after craniotomy?"

## The "Brain Surgery" Fear

When I tell patients in Hyderabad that they need surgery for a brain tumor, their first question is often not about the procedure itself, but about the aftermath. *"Doctor, will I be the same person?"* *"How long until I can go back to work?"*

These fears are natural. The brain makes us who we are. But it's important to know that modern neurosurgery has evolved significantly. With techniques like **[Awake Craniotomy](/blog/awake-craniotomy-brain-tumor-guide)** and minimally invasive keyhole surgery, we are not just focused on removing the tumor, but on preserving your quality of life.

This guide outlines the typical recovery timeline for a standard craniotomy (brain tumor removal) to help you and your family prepare.

## Phase 1: The Hospital Stay (Days 0–5)

### Day 0: Surgery & ICU
*   **Immediately Post-Op:** You will wake up in the recovery room and then be moved to the Neuro-ICU for close monitoring.
*   **Waking Up:** You might feel groggy. We will frequently check your pupil reaction and ask you to move your arms and legs.
*   **Headache:** You may have a headache, but we provide pain relief.
*   **Tubes:** You will likely have an IV line, a urinary catheter, and possibly a head drain to remove excess fluid.

### Day 1: Mobilization
*   **Moving:** We encourage you to sit up in bed or a chair. This is crucial to prevent pneumonia and blood clots.
*   **Eating:** If you are swallowing well, you can start with liquids and soft diet.
*   **Scans:** A CT scan or MRI is usually done to check the surgical site.

### Day 2-4: The Ward
*   **Transfer:** Once stable (usually Day 1 or 2), you move from ICU to a regular room.
*   **Walking:** You will be walking in the corridors with assistance.
*   **Tubes Removed:** The catheter and IVs are typically removed.
*   **Physiotherapy:** If you have any weakness, our rehab team starts gentle exercises.

### Day 4-5: Discharge
Most patients go home by Day 4 or 5. You are ready for discharge when:
1.  You are eating and drinking normally.
2.  You can walk independently (or with your baseline level of assistance).
3.  Pain is well-controlled with oral medication.

## Phase 2: First Month at Home (Weeks 1–4)

This is the main healing phase. Your body needs rest.

### Incision Care
*   **Keep it Dry:** Keep the incision dry. You can usually shower after Day 4-5 but don't soak the wound.
*   **Stitches:** Staples or stitches are removed around **Day 10-14** in the outpatient clinic.
*   **Swelling:** You might notice some swelling or bruising around the eyes or face. This is normal and gravity will help it settle over a week. Sleeping with your head elevated on 2 pillows helps.

### Common Symptoms
*   **Fatigue:** This is the #1 complaint. You will feel tired easily. Listen to your body and take naps.
*   **Headaches:** Occasional sharp pains or a dull ache around the scar are common as nerves heal.
*   **Sensory Changes:** You might hear a "clicking" sound or feel fluid moving; this is just air/fluid settling in the space where the tumor was.

### Activity
*   **Walking:** Walk daily, increasing distance gradually.
*   **No Lifting:** Avoid lifting anything heavier than 5kg (like a bucket of water) for 4 weeks.
*   **No Straining:** Avoid constipation (we prescribe softeners) to prevent pressure in the head.

## Phase 3: Returning to Normal (Weeks 6–12)

By now, the external wound is healed, and you are regaining stamina.

*   **Work:** Most people with desk jobs return to work around **6-8 weeks**. Start with half-days or Work From Home. If your job involves heavy labor or driving, you may need 3 months.
*   **Driving:** This is a major safety issue. Generally, you must be seizure-free for a specific period (often 3-6 months) before driving. **Do not drive until cleared by your neurosurgeon.**
*   **Hair:** You can color your hair after the incision is fully healed (usually after 6 weeks).

## Phase 4: Long-Term Follow-up

Recovery doesn't end at 3 months.
*   **Scans:** You will have regular MRI scans (e.g., every 3-6 months) to monitor for recurrence.
*   **Medication:** If you were on anti-seizure medication, do not stop it abruptly. We usually taper it off over time.

## When to Call Us Urgently? (Red Flags)

While recovery is usually smooth, watch out for these signs and come to the [emergency](/contact) or call us:
1.  **Fever** over 101°F (could indicate infection).
2.  **Fluid Leak:** Clear, watery fluid dripping from your nose or the wound (CSF leak).
3.  **Wound Issues:** Redness, pus, or opening of the incision.
4.  **New Symptoms:** Sudden weakness, speech difficulty, or a seizure.
5.  **Severe Headache:** A sudden, severe headache accompanied by vomiting.

## Conclusion

Recovering from brain tumor surgery is a journey, not a sprint. While the first week is intense, most patients in Hyderabad are surprised by how quickly they get back to their routine. Whether it's a [benign meningioma](/services/brain-tumor-surgery-hyderabad) or a more complex tumor, our goal is to get you back to your life safely.
