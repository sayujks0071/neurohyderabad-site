## Introduction

This is an example blog post demonstrating the new blog workflow system. It shows how content is structured using MDX files with YAML frontmatter.

## Key Features

The new blog system includes:

- **Standardized frontmatter** - All posts follow the same schema
- **Automatic SEO** - Metadata generated from frontmatter
- **JSON-LD schema** - Structured data for search engines
- **E-E-A-T components** - Author, sources, review information
- **Internal linking** - Easy linking to conditions and treatments

## Content Structure

Blog posts are written in Markdown/MDX format, making them easy to edit and maintain. The frontmatter contains all metadata, while the body contains the actual content.

## Next Steps

To create your own blog post, run:

```bash
npm run new:blog -- --title "Your Blog Title" --category spine --primaryKeyword "your keyword"
```

Or use AI to generate initial content:

```bash
npm run new:blog -- --title "Your Blog Title" --ai
```
