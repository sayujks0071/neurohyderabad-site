faq:
  - question: "Is a meningioma a type of brain cancer?"
    answer: "No. More than 90% of meningiomas are Grade I (benign). They grow slowly and do not spread to other parts of the body. However, even benign tumors can be dangerous if they press on the brain or nerves."
  - question: "Can a meningioma stop growing?"
    answer: "Some meningiomas grow very slowly or calcify and stop growing naturally. This is why 'wait and watch' with regular MRI scans is often the first line of management for small, asymptomatic tumors in older patients."
  - question: "How long is the recovery after meningioma surgery?"
    answer: "Most patients are discharged in 3-4 days. You can walk the next day. Full recovery and return to normal activities typically takes 4-6 weeks, depending on the tumor's location."
  - question: "Is Gamma Knife better than surgery for meningioma?"
    answer: "Gamma Knife (Radiosurgery) is excellent for small tumors (<3cm) that are hard to reach or for patients unfit for open surgery. However, large tumors causing pressure symptoms usually require surgical removal first."
  - question: "What are the warning signs that a meningioma is growing?"
    answer: "New or worsening headaches, vision changes (blurriness/double vision), seizures, weakness in an arm or leg, or personality changes suggest the tumor is exerting pressure and may need treatment."

## "It's benign, but it's still a brain tumor."

Hearing the word "tumor" is terrifying. When I tell a patient they have a **meningioma**, the first reaction is often panic, followed by confusion when I say, "We might not need to operate right away."

Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors, accounting for about 30% of all brain diagnoses. The good news? The vast majority are **benign (non-cancerous)** and slow-growing. Unlike gliomas, which grow *inside* the brain tissue, meningiomas grow from the meninges—the protective layers covering the brain—and push the brain inward.

In my practice at Yashoda Hospital, Malakpet, I see two types of meningioma patients: those who found it accidentally after an MRI for a headache (incidental finding), and those with clear symptoms like vision loss or seizures.

This guide explains how we decide between "waiting and watching" and performing surgery, and what you can expect from modern treatments.

## What is a Meningioma?

A meningioma arises from the arachnoid cells of the meninges. Think of it like a stone growing in your shoe. The stone (tumor) isn't part of your foot (brain), but as it gets bigger, it presses on your foot, causing pain and dysfunction.

*   **Grade I (Benign):** ~90% of cases. Slow-growing cells. Cure is possible with surgery.
*   **Grade II (Atypical):** Grow faster and have a higher chance of coming back.
*   **Grade III (Malignant):** Rare and aggressive (cancerous).

## Option 1: Active Surveillance ("Wait and Watch")

If you have a small meningioma that was found by accident and you have **no symptoms**, surgery is often unnecessary.

**We typically recommend observation if:**
*   The tumor is small (less than 2-3 cm).
*   It is not pressing on critical structures (like the optic nerve or brainstem).
*   You are older (over 65-70) and the tumor is calcified (hardened).
*   You have no seizures, weakness, or focal deficits.

**The Protocol:**
We schedule a repeat MRI scan in 6 months. If the tumor hasn't changed, we space the scans out to once a year. Many of my patients live their entire lives with a small meningioma that never requires surgery.

## Option 2: When Surgery is Necessary

We shift from observation to intervention when the tumor threatens your quality of life or brain function.

**Indications for Surgery:**
1.  **Size and Mass Effect:** The tumor is large (>3 cm) and is compressing the brain, causing edema (swelling).
2.  **Neurological Symptoms:** You have weakness in an arm/leg, difficulty speaking, or unsteady walking.
3.  **Vision Loss:** Tumors near the optic nerves (tuberculum sellae or olfactory groove meningiomas) can silently steal your vision. **Surgery here is urgent.**
4.  **Seizures:** The tumor is irritating the brain surface, causing electrical storms.
5.  **Rapid Growth:** A tumor that visibly enlarges between two MRI scans.

### The Surgical Approach: Craniotomy

The goal of [meningioma surgery](/services/brain-tumor-surgery-hyderabad) is **Gross Total Resection**—removing the tumor and the covering it grows from (Simpson Grade I removal) to prevent recurrence.

*   **Microsurgery:** We use a high-powered operating microscope to separate the tumor from the delicate brain vessels and nerves.
*   **Neuronavigation:** Like a GPS for the brain, this helps us locate the tumor precisely and make smaller incisions.
*   **Ultrasonic Aspirator (CUSA):** This device vibrates to dissolve the tumor core, allowing us to "debulk" it and collapse it inward, protecting the surrounding brain.

For tumors in critical locations, we may perform an **[Awake Craniotomy](/blog/awake-craniotomy-brain-tumor-guide)** to monitor speech or movement in real-time.

## Option 3: Stereotactic Radiosurgery (Gamma Knife)

For some patients, open surgery isn't the best option. **Radiosurgery** (SRS) uses focused radiation beams to stop the tumor's growth by damaging its DNA. It doesn't "remove" the tumor but kills it so it shrinks or stabilizes over time.

**Best for:**
*   Small tumors (<3 cm) deep in the brain or skull base (difficult to reach surgically).
*   Residual tumor left behind after surgery (to spare a nerve).
*   Elderly or medically unfit patients.

## Recovery After Meningioma Surgery

Recovery is often faster than patients expect because we usually don't cut *into* the brain, just *around* it.

*   **Hospital Stay:** 3-5 days.
*   **Walking:** Day 1 post-op.
*   **Stitches:** Removed on Day 10-14.
*   **Return to Work:** 3-4 weeks for desk jobs; 6-8 weeks for strenuous work.
*   **Seizure Precautions:** You may need anti-seizure medication for a few weeks as a precaution.

## Why Choose Yashoda Hospital for Brain Tumor Care?

Brain surgery requires a team, not just a surgeon.
*   **Advanced Imaging:** We use [specialized MRI protocols](/blog/understanding-brain-mri-tumor-report-guide) to map the tumor's blood supply.
*   **Tumor Board:** Complex cases are discussed with oncologists and radiologists.
*   **Safety First:** We prioritize function over total removal. Leaving a tiny sliver of tumor is better than damaging a facial nerve. We can zap the remnant with radiation later.

## Summary

A meningioma diagnosis is a life-changing event, but it is **not** a death sentence. With modern microsurgery and radiosurgery, the outcomes for benign meningiomas are excellent.

If you have a scan showing a "lesion" or "space-occupying lesion," don't panic. Bring your MRI for a review. We will verify if it's truly a meningioma and design a plan that keeps you safe—whether that's surgery tomorrow or just another scan next year.
