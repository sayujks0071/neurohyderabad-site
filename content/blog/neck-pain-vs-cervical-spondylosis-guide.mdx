faq:
  - question: "Can cervical spondylosis cause dizziness?"
    answer: "Yes, in some cases. This is often called cervicogenic dizziness. It happens when tight neck muscles or joint issues affect the body's balance signals. However, frequent dizziness should always be evaluated to rule out other causes."
  - question: "Is walking good for neck pain?"
    answer: "Yes. Gentle walking improves blood flow and posture, which can help relax tight neck muscles. Avoid looking down at your phone while walking, as this increases strain on the neck."
  - question: "How do I fix 'text neck'?"
    answer: "The best fix is prevention: hold your phone at eye level, take frequent breaks, and stretch your neck muscles. If pain persists, physiotherapy and posture correction exercises are very effective."
  - question: "When is neck pain an emergency?"
    answer: "Seek immediate care if neck pain is accompanied by severe headache, fever, loss of balance, or weakness in your arms or legs. These could be signs of infection or severe nerve compression."
  - question: "Does spondylosis always need surgery?"
    answer: "No. The vast majority of cervical spondylosis cases are managed with medication, physiotherapy, and lifestyle changes. Surgery is reserved for patients with severe nerve compression or spinal cord issues (myelopathy)."

## Key Takeaways
*   **The Difference:** "Text neck" or muscle strain stays in the neck/shoulders. Spondylosis often sends pain shooting down the arm.
*   **Nerve Signals:** Numbness or tingling in the fingers is a hallmark of nerve compression (radiculopathy), not just stiffness.
*   **Posture Impact:** Looking down at a screen adds up to 27 kg of pressure on your cervical spine.
*   **Urgent Care:** Balance issues or clumsiness with your hands (dropping things) are signs of spinal cord pressure (myelopathy) and need immediate attention.
*   **Treatment:** Most neck pain resolves with posture correction and physio. Spondylosis may need targeted medication or injections.

## Stiff Neck or Spondylosis?

It's a familiar scene in Hyderabad's IT corridors: you finish a long day of coding or meetings, look up from your laptop, and feel that familiar stiffness in the back of your neck. Maybe you rub your shoulders, apply a heat pack, and hope it goes away.

But what if the pain doesn't go away? What if it starts traveling down your arm or makes your fingers tingle?

Many patients I see at my clinic in Jubilee Hills worry that every neck ache is "cervical spondylosis." While spondylosis is common, it's distinct from simple mechanical neck pain. Understanding the difference is crucial for getting the right treatment.

## What is Mechanical Neck Pain?

Mechanical neck pain is usually caused by the muscles, ligaments, or joints (facets) of the neck. It is the upper-body equivalent of [mechanical back pain](/blog/sciatica-vs-normal-back-pain-guide).

**Typical Symptoms:**
*   **Ache & Stiffness:** A dull, constant ache in the neck or upper shoulders (trapezius muscle).
*   **Limited Motion:** You find it hard to turn your head fully to the left or right, especially while driving.
*   **Localized:** The pain stays in the neck area. It does not shoot down the arm past the elbow.
*   **Headaches:** Tension headaches that start at the base of the skull are common.

**Common Causes:**
*   **"Text Neck":** Constantly looking down at smartphones or tablets.
*   **Poor Ergonomics:** Monitor too low, chair too soft, or hunching over a desk.
*   **Sleeping Wrong:** Using a pillow that is too high or too flat.

## What is Cervical Spondylosis?

Cervical spondylosis is a general term for age-related wear and tear in the cervical spine (neck). It includes disc degeneration and bone spurs (osteophytes). When this degeneration pinches a nerve, it becomes **Cervical Radiculopathy**.

**Typical Symptoms:**
*   **Shooting Pain:** Sharp or electric pain that travels from the neck down into the shoulder, arm, or even the hand.
*   **Numbness:** Tingling or "pins and needles" in the fingers. The specific fingers affected can tell a neurosurgeon exactly which nerve is pinched.
*   **Weakness:** Your arm might feel heavy, or you might have a weak grip (dropping coffee cups or keys).
*   **Relief with Rest:** Pain often improves when you lie down or support your neck, taking the weight of the head off the spine.

**Common Causes:**
*   **Disc Herniation:** The soft center of a disc pushes out and presses on a nerve root.
*   **Bone Spurs:** Osteophytes narrow the space where nerves exit the spine (foraminal stenosis).
*   **Aging:** Natural dehydration of discs over time.

## The "Spurling's Test" Concept

Doctors use a maneuver called the Spurling's test to diagnose nerve compression. While you should not force this if it hurts, the principle is simple:
*   Extension (looking up) and lateral flexion (tilting the ear to the shoulder) closes the space for the nerve.
*   If doing this reproduces the **shooting pain down your arm**, it is a strong sign of a pinched nerve (spondylosis/radiculopathy).
*   If it just causes neck pain, it is likely facet joint pain or muscle strain.

## Why "Text Neck" is a Gateway Drug to Spondylosis

The human head weighs about 5 kg. However, as you bend your neck forward to look at a phone:
*   At 15 degrees, the weight on the spine becomes 12 kg.
*   At 60 degrees (common texting posture), it reaches **27 kg**.

Sustaining this weight for hours daily accelerates the degeneration of your cervical discs. What starts as muscle strain in your 20s can turn into early cervical spondylosis in your 30s.

## When to See a Specialist

Most neck pain is annoying but not dangerous. However, you should book an appointment if:
1.  **Pain Radiates:** The pain travels down your arm.
2.  **Sensory Changes:** You feel numbness or tingling in your hands.
3.  **Persistence:** The pain has lasted more than 2 weeks despite rest and painkillers.
4.  **Trauma:** The pain started after a fall or car accident (whiplash).

If you need a detailed evaluation, we can help interpret your symptoms and [MRI reports](/blog/understanding-mri-spine-report-guide) to give you a clear diagnosis.

## Red Flags: Cervical Myelopathy

There is a more severe condition called **Cervical Myelopathy**, where the spinal cord itself is compressed. This is an emergency. Watch for:
*   **Balance Issues:** Feeling unsteady on your feet or walking "like a drunk person."
*   **Loss of Dexterity:** Difficulty buttoning a shirt, writing, or handling small objects like coins.
*   **Bowel/Bladder Changes:** Urgency or incontinence.
*   **Shock-like Sensation:** A feeling of electric shock down the spine when bending the neck forward (Lhermitte's sign).

If you notice these, seek medical help immediately.

## Treatment Options

For confirmed cervical spondylosis without myelopathy, we start conservatively:
*   **Medication:** Nerve-calming drugs (like pregabalin) and short-term anti-inflammatories.
*   **Physiotherapy:** Traction and strengthening exercises.
*   **Ergonomics:** Adjusting your workstation to keep the screen at eye level.

If conservative care fails, or if there is severe nerve compression, surgical options like [Endoscopic Spine Surgery](/services/endoscopic-spine-surgery-hyderabad) or Disc Replacement are highly effective. These modern techniques minimize tissue damage and allow for a rapid return to work—vital for our busy professionals.

## Summary

Don't let neck pain rule your life. Identify the type of pain you have: is it a muscular protest against your posture, or a nerve crying out for help?
*   **Mechanical:** Move more, fix your posture, stretch.
*   **Nerve (Spondylosis):** Rest, medication, and specialist evaluation.

If you are unsure or in pain, [book a consultation](/appointments) today. Early diagnosis prevents long-term nerve damage.
