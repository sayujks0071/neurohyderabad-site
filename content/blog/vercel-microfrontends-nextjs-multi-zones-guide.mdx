## Key Takeaways
*   Vercel Microfrontends lets one domain route to multiple Next.js apps without brittle client-side hacks.
*   Multi-Zones keeps marketing and documentation apps independently deployable while sharing a single URL surface.
*   A shell app handles primary routes and proxies /docs to the docs app in development and production.
*   microfrontends.json and withMicrofrontends() define routing and local fallback behavior.
*   Cross-zone links can be prefetched to keep navigation fast and seamless.

## Why this matters for drsayuj.info
As drsayuj.info grows, a multi-zone setup can separate fast-changing sections (knowledge base, research, or content hubs) from stable marketing and appointment flows. This helps teams ship updates independently, isolate risk, and preserve SEO-critical pages while the rest of the site evolves.

## Demo and quick start
*   Demo URL: <https://vercel-microfrontends-multi-zones.vercel.app/>
*   Deploy to Vercel: use the Vercel Microfrontends Multi-Zones project from the Vercel Examples repository.

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js 20.x or later
*   pnpm 9.4.0
*   Git

### Local development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vercel/examples
cd microfrontends/nextjs-multi-zones
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts both apps:
*   Marketing app: <http://localhost:3000>
*   Docs app: <http://localhost:3001> (proxied through the marketing app)
*   Unified local entry point: <http://localhost:3024>

## Architecture overview
This reference implementation splits one domain into two independently deployable apps.

| Application | Role | Routes | Local Port |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Marketing | Shell app for homepage, pricing, and marketing pages | /, /pricing, /about | 3000 |
| Documentation | Dedicated docs microfrontend | /docs, /docs/* | 3001 |

Shared packages in the workspace keep linting, TypeScript, and formatting consistent.

## Routing configuration (microfrontends.json)
The shell app declares which routes belong to which microfrontend:
```json
{
  "applications": {
    "microfrontends-marketing": {
      "development": {
        "local": 3000,
        "fallback": "microfrontends-marketing.vercel.app"
      }
    },
    "microfrontends-docs": {
      "development": { "local": 3001 },
      "routing": [
        { "group": "docs", "paths": ["/docs", "/docs/:path*"] }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Next.js configuration
Each app enables microfrontends in its Next.js config:
```ts
import { withMicrofrontends } from "@vercel/microfrontends/next/config";
import { withVercelToolbar } from "@vercel/toolbar/plugins/next";

export default withVercelToolbar()(
  withMicrofrontends(nextConfig, { debug: true })
);
```

## How cross-zone routing works
1. The marketing app reads microfrontends.json to discover which routes live in other zones.
2. Requests to /docs are routed to the docs app via Vercel Microfrontends.
3. Responses are streamed back seamlessly, so users stay on the same domain.
4. In production, each zone is deployed independently while routing stays consistent.

## Development workflow
Work on individual apps in isolation:
```bash
cd apps/marketing
pnpm dev

cd apps/docs
pnpm dev
```

Quality checks across all apps:
```bash
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm checks
```

## Optimizing cross-zone navigation
To speed up transitions between zones, preload links across apps.

1. Wrap the root layout in the provider:
```tsx
import { PrefetchCrossZoneLinksProvider } from "@vercel/microfrontends/next/client";

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <PrefetchCrossZoneLinksProvider>
          {children}
        </PrefetchCrossZoneLinksProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

2. Use the enhanced Link component:
```tsx
import { Link } from "@vercel/microfrontends/next/client";

<Link href="/docs">View Documentation</Link>
<Link href="/docs/getting-started">Getting Started</Link>
```

## Adding another microfrontend
1. Create a new app under apps/.
2. Add routing rules in microfrontends.json.
3. Add the app to workspace configuration.
4. Deploy the new zone independently on Vercel.

## Production checklist
*   Confirm each zone builds and deploys independently.
*   Keep shared lint and TypeScript configs aligned.
*   Monitor cross-zone navigation and cache headers.
*   Keep routing rules minimal and explicit to avoid collisions.
