faq:
  - question: "Is Text Neck permanent?"
    answer: "In early stages, it is reversible with posture correction and exercise. However, chronic neglect can lead to permanent disc degeneration and bone spurs (early spondylosis)."
  - question: "How long does it take to fix Text Neck?"
    answer: "With consistent ergonomic changes and exercises, most patients in Hyderabad report significant pain relief within 2-4 weeks."
  - question: "Can a cervical pillow help?"
    answer: "Yes, a contoured cervical pillow maintains the natural curve of your neck while sleeping, which is crucial for recovery. However, it does not replace daytime posture correction."
  - question: "Does Text Neck cause headaches?"
    answer: "Absolutely. 'Cervicogenic headaches' are common, often starting at the base of the skull and radiating to the forehead, caused by muscle tension in the upper neck."
  - question: "When should I get an MRI for neck pain?"
    answer: "If you have pain radiating down your arm, numbness in fingers, or weakness in your grip, an MRI is recommended to rule out a herniated disc."

## The "Cyberabad" Spine Epidemic

If you walk into any coffee shop in Jubilee Hills or any office in Raheja Mindspace, you will see the same posture everywhere: head down, shoulders rounded, eyes glued to a screen.

In Hyderabad, the IT capital, we are seeing a massive surge in young patients—some as young as 20—walking into our clinics with the spine X-rays of a 60-year-old. The culprit? **Text Neck Syndrome**.

It starts as a dull ache after a long coding session. Then it becomes a constant stiffness. Eventually, it can lead to early [Cervical Spondylosis](/blog/cervical-spondylosis-neck-pain-hyderabad) and chronic pain.

This guide explains what "Tech Neck" is actually doing to your spine and, more importantly, how to reverse it before you need surgical intervention.

## The Science: Your Head is Heavy

The human head weighs about 5 kg (10-12 lbs) when in a neutral position (ears aligned with shoulders).

However, as you tilt your head forward to look at a smartphone or a laptop screen, the effective load on your cervical spine increases dramatically due to gravity and leverage:

*   **15 degrees tilt:** Head weighs **12 kg**
*   **30 degrees tilt:** Head weighs **18 kg**
*   **45 degrees tilt:** Head weighs **22 kg**
*   **60 degrees tilt:** Head weighs **27 kg** (That’s like carrying an 8-year-old child on your neck!)

When you hold this position for 8-10 hours a day, the muscles in the back of your neck become overstretched and weak, while the muscles in the front become tight. More dangerously, the pressure on your intervertebral discs increases, accelerating wear and tear.

## Symptoms: Is it Text Neck or Something Else?

Text neck doesn't happen overnight. It is a cumulative stress injury. Common symptoms include:

1.  **Instant Upper Back Pain:** A sharp or nagging pain specifically between the shoulder blades (interscapular pain).
2.  **Neck Stiffness:** Reduced range of motion; difficulty looking over your shoulder while driving.
3.  **Headaches:** Tension headaches that start at the base of the skull.
4.  **Forward Head Posture:** Your head naturally pokes forward even when you think you are standing straight.
5.  **Shoulder Pain:** General aching in the trapezius muscles.

### When to Seek Urgent Care (Red Flags)

While most Text Neck is muscular, it can progress to nerve compression (radiculopathy). See a specialist immediately if you experience:
*   Electric shock-like pain shooting down your arm.
*   Numbness or tingling in your fingers.
*   Weakness in your hand (dropping objects).
*   Loss of balance or coordination (signs of myelopathy).

## Prevention: The Hyderabad IT Survival Kit

You don't need to quit your job to fix your neck. You just need to change *how* you work.

### 1. The "Eye-Level" Rule
The top of your monitor should be at or slightly below eye level. If you work on a laptop, **get a laptop stand** and use an external keyboard and mouse. Looking *down* at a laptop on a desk is the #1 cause of neck strain.

### 2. The 20-20-20 Rule
For every 20 minutes of screen time, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This relaxes the eye muscles, but use it as a cue to reset your posture: roll your shoulders back and tuck your chin.

### 3. Smartphone Hygiene
Bring the phone up to your face; don't bring your face down to the phone. Your elbows should be tucked into your ribs to support the weight.

### 4. Desk Ergonomics
Ensure your elbows are at a 90-degree angle and your feet are flat on the floor. If your feet dangle, use a footrest. A supportive chair with a headrest is a worthy investment.

## 3 Simple Exercises You Can Do at Your Desk

You don't need a gym. Incorporate these into your workday:

**1. Chin Tucks (The "Double Chin"):**
Sit straight. Gently pull your chin straight back as if you are making a double chin. Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times. This strengthens the deep cervical flexors.

**2. Scapular Squeezes:**
Imagine squeezing a pencil between your shoulder blades. Pull your shoulders back and down. Hold for 5 seconds. This combats rounded shoulders.

**3. Corner Stretch:**
Stand in a corner of a room, arms up like a goalpost on the walls. Lean forward gently until you feel a stretch in your chest. This opens up the tight pectoral muscles caused by hunching.

## Treatment Options

If ergonomic changes aren't enough, we escalate treatment:

*   **Physiotherapy:** Ultrasound therapy and myofascial release to break down muscle knots (trigger points).
*   **Medication:** Short-term muscle relaxants or anti-inflammatories to break the pain cycle.
*   **Injection Therapy:** Trigger point injections for stubborn muscle spasms.

**Is surgery needed?**
Rarely. Surgery is only considered if the poor posture has caused a structural disc herniation that is compressing a nerve and failing to respond to conservative care.

## Conclusion

Text Neck is the "smoking" of the digital age. It’s a silent epidemic that, if left unchecked, will result in a generation of people with spine problems in their 40s.

Take control of your posture today. Your spine is the only one you get.
