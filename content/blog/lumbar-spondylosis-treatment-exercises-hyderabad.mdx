  - question: "Is walking good for Lumbar Spondylosis?"
    answer: "Yes, walking is a low-impact exercise that helps maintain spine flexibility and strengthens the muscles supporting your lower back."
  - question: "What is the difference between Spondylosis and Spondylitis?"

## What is Lumbar Spondylosis?

As we age, our hair turns gray, and our skin develops wrinkles. Similarly, our spine undergoes changes. **Lumbar Spondylosis** is essentially "gray hair of the spine"—a general term for age-related wear and tear of the spinal discs and joints.

In Hyderabad, I frequently see patients over 50 complaining of stiffness in the lower back, especially in the mornings. This is often the first sign of spondylosis. While the term sounds scary, it is a very common condition and is **highly manageable without surgery**.

## Common Symptoms

*   **Morning Stiffness:** Feeling "locked up" when you wake up.
*   **Lower Back Pain:** A dull ache that may worsen after standing or sitting for long periods.
*   **Decreased Range of Motion:** Difficulty bending forward or backward.
*   **Radiating Pain:** If bone spurs press on nerves, you might feel pain in the buttocks or legs (Sciatica).

## Spondylosis vs. Slip Disc: What’s the Difference?

Many patients confuse the two.
*   **Slip Disc (Herniated Disc):** Often happens suddenly (lifting a heavy weight) and affects the soft inner gel of the disc. Common in younger adults (30s-40s).
*   **Spondylosis:** Happens gradually over years. Involves drying out of discs and formation of bone spurs (osteophytes). Common in older adults (50+).

## Non-Surgical Treatment Options

95% of Spondylosis cases are treated conservatively.

### 1. Physiotherapy & Exercise
Strengthening the core and back muscles takes the load off the spine.

### 2. Medication
Anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) can help reduce acute pain flare-ups.

### 3. Lifestyle Modifications
*   **Ergonomics:** Ensure your work chair supports your lower back.
*   **Weight Management:** Losing excess weight reduces stress on the lumbar spine.

## Safe Exercises for Lumbar Spondylosis

*Note: Always consult a doctor before starting a new exercise routine.*

### 1. Pelvic Tilt
Helps strengthen abdominal muscles.
*   **How:** Lie on your back with knees bent. Tighten your stomach muscles and press your lower back into the floor. Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.

### 2. Knee-to-Chest Stretch
Relieves pressure on spinal nerves.
*   **How:** Lie on your back. Gently pull one knee towards your chest using your hands. Hold for 20 seconds. Repeat with the other leg.

### 3. Cat-Camel Stretch
Improves spine flexibility.
*   **How:** Get on your hands and knees. Arch your back up like a cat (exhale), then let it sag down (inhale). Repeat 10 times gently.

## When Should You Consider Surgery?

Surgery is the **last resort**. We only consider it if:
1.  Pain is unbearable and not relieved by medication/physio.
2.  There is significant nerve compression causing leg weakness (foot drop).
3.  You have difficulty walking due to spinal stenosis (claudication).

In such cases, minimally invasive procedures like [Endoscopic Spine Surgery](/services/minimally-invasive-spine-surgery) offer a safe solution with quick recovery.

## Conclusion

Lumbar Spondylosis is a part of aging, but pain doesn't have to be. With the right exercises and lifestyle changes, you can lead an active life.
