faq:
  - question: "What is the first sign of an acoustic neuroma?"
    answer: "The most common early sign is subtle hearing loss in one ear, often accompanied by tinnitus (ringing in the ear). Some patients also notice mild balance issues."
  - question: "Is acoustic neuroma cancer?"
    answer: "No, acoustic neuromas are benign (non-cancerous) tumors. They grow slowly and do not spread to other parts of the body, but they can cause problems by pressing on nerves and the brainstem."
  - question: "Can hearing return after acoustic neuroma surgery?"
    answer: "It depends on the size of the tumor and pre-operative hearing levels. While modern microsurgery aims to preserve the hearing nerve, restoring lost hearing is difficult. The primary goal is often to preserve remaining hearing."
  - question: "What is the difference between surgery and radiosurgery?"
    answer: "Surgery (microsurgery) removes the tumor physically. Radiosurgery (like Gamma Knife or CyberKnife) uses focused radiation to stop the tumor from growing. The choice depends on tumor size, age, and symptoms."
  - question: "How long is the recovery after surgery?"
    answer: "Most patients spend 3-4 days in the hospital. Full recovery and return to normal activities typically takes 4-6 weeks, though balance rehabilitation may continue longer."

## Key Takeaways
*   **The Silent Symptom:** One-sided hearing loss is the most common early warning sign of an Acoustic Neuroma. Don't ignore it.
*   **Not Cancer:** These are benign, slow-growing tumors on the balance nerve. They do not spread like cancer.
*   **Balance Issues:** Unsteadiness or dizziness often accompanies hearing loss.
*   **Treatment Options:** Small tumors can be monitored ("Wait and Scan"). Larger or growing tumors may need microsurgery or focused radiation.
*   **Facial Nerve Safety:** Preserving facial movement is a top priority during treatment.

## Is it just hearing loss, or something more?

You notice that you're having trouble hearing conversations on the phone with your right ear. Or maybe there's a constant ringing sound (tinnitus) that won't go away. You assume it's just age or ear wax. But when hearing loss affects only *one* side, it warrants a closer look.

In my neurosurgery practice in Hyderabad, I frequently see patients who have ignored these subtle signs for months or even years. While most hearing loss is benign, one-sided symptoms can sometimes indicate an **Acoustic Neuroma** (also known as a Vestibular Schwannoma).

Understanding this condition can help you make informed decisions about your health. This guide explains what Acoustic Neuroma is, how we diagnose it, and the modern treatment options available today.

## What is an Acoustic Neuroma?

An Acoustic Neuroma is a **benign (non-cancerous)**, slow-growing tumor that develops on the main nerve leading from your inner ear to your brain. This nerve is called the vestibulocochlear nerve (8th cranial nerve), and it has two parts: one for hearing and one for balance.

Because these tumors grow on the nerve sheath (Schwann cells), they are more accurately called **Vestibular Schwannomas**. As the tumor grows, it presses on the hearing and balance nerves, causing the classic symptoms. If it grows very large, it can press on the brainstem and cerebellum, which can be serious.

**Key Facts:**
*   **Rare:** It affects about 1 in 100,000 people per year.
*   **Slow Growth:** Most grow very slowly, sometimes taking years to become noticeable.
*   **Location:** They are located in a space called the Cerebellopontine Angle (CPA), deep inside the skull base.

## Common Symptoms

The symptoms of an acoustic neuroma often appear gradually and can be easily mistaken for other ear problems.

### 1. Hearing Loss (One-Sided)
This is the hallmark symptom, present in over 90% of patients. It is usually gradual, but in some rare cases, it can be sudden. You might notice:
*   Difficulty understanding speech on one side, especially in noisy rooms.
*   Preferring one ear for phone calls.

### 2. Tinnitus (Ringing in the Ear)
A constant ringing, buzzing, or hissing sound in the affected ear. This can be annoying and is often what drives patients to see an ENT specialist first.

### 3. Unsteadiness or Balance Issues
Since the tumor grows on the balance nerve, you might feel:
*   Mild unsteadiness when walking.
*   A feeling of "veering" to one side.
*   True vertigo (spinning sensation) is less common but can occur.

### 4. Facial Numbness or Weakness
As the tumor gets larger, it can press on the nearby Trigeminal Nerve (5th cranial nerve), causing numbness or tingling on one side of the face. In very large tumors, it can affect the Facial Nerve (7th cranial nerve), causing weakness, though this is rare early on.

## Diagnosis: The Importance of MRI

If you have one-sided hearing loss, a simple hearing test (audiogram) is the first step. If the test shows "asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss," an MRI is mandatory.

The gold standard for diagnosis is a **Contrast-Enhanced MRI of the Brain**. This scan can detect tumors as small as 1-2 millimeters. At our center in Hyderabad, we use high-resolution MRI protocols to visualize not just the tumor, but also its relationship to the facial nerve and brainstem. (See our guide on [Understanding Brain MRI Reports](/blog/understanding-brain-mri-tumor-report-guide) for more details).

## Treatment Options: It’s Not Always Surgery

Not every acoustic neuroma needs immediate surgery. Treatment decisions are complex and depend on three main factors: **Size of the tumor**, **Age/Health of the patient**, and **Status of hearing**.

### 1. Observation ("Wait and Scan")
For small tumors (less than 1.5 cm) that are not causing major symptoms, especially in older patients, we may choose to simply monitor them.
*   **Protocol:** An MRI is done every 6-12 months.
*   **Why?** Many of these tumors stop growing or grow very slowly. Avoiding treatment risks preserves quality of life.

### 2. Microsurgery
Surgery is the treatment of choice for:
*   Large tumors compressing the brainstem.
*   Tumors that are growing rapidly.
*   Young patients who need a long-term cure.

**The Goal of Surgery:** Complete removal of the tumor while **preserving the facial nerve**.
Modern microsurgery has made this procedure much safer. We use:
*   **Operating Microscopes:** For high magnification.
*   **Facial Nerve Monitoring:** An intraoperative device that alerts the surgeon if they are close to the facial nerve, significantly reducing the risk of facial paralysis.

There are different surgical approaches (Retrosigmoid, Translabyrinthine, Middle Fossa), and the choice depends on your specific hearing levels and tumor size. For more on brain tumor surgery safety, read our guide on [Brain Tumor Surgery](/services/brain-tumor-surgery-hyderabad).

### 3. Stereotactic Radiosurgery (Gamma Knife / CyberKnife)
This is a non-invasive option for small to medium-sized tumors (usually under 3 cm). It uses highly focused radiation beams to stop the tumor's growth.
*   **Pros:** No incision, day-care procedure, lower immediate risk to the facial nerve.
*   **Cons:** The tumor is not removed (it just stops growing), and there is a small risk of long-term side effects.

## Recovery and Life After Treatment

Recovery from acoustic neuroma treatment is generally good, but patience is required.

*   **Hospital Stay:** Usually 3-5 days for surgery.
*   **Balance:** You may feel dizzy or off-balance for a few weeks as your brain compensates for the loss of balance function on one side. Vestibular rehabilitation exercises are very helpful.
*   **Hearing:** If hearing was already lost, it usually does not return. If hearing was good, we try to preserve it, but it is challenging.
*   **Facial Function:** With modern monitoring, the risk of permanent facial weakness is low for small and medium tumors.

## When to See a Specialist

Do not ignore changes in your hearing. You should see a specialist if:
*   You notice hearing loss in only one ear.
*   You have persistent tinnitus in one ear.
*   You experience unexplained dizziness or balance problems.
*   You have facial numbness or tingling.

## Red Flags: When to Seek Urgent Care

While acoustic neuromas are slow-growing, large tumors can cause fluid buildup in the brain (hydrocephalus). Seek emergency care if you experience:
*   Severe, worsening headache, especially in the morning.
*   Nausea and vomiting along with headache.
*   Sudden double vision or blurred vision.
*   Severe unsteadiness or inability to walk.

## Summary

Acoustic Neuroma is a treatable condition. The key is early detection. With modern MRI imaging and advanced microsurgical techniques available in Hyderabad, outcomes are excellent. whether it's "Wait and Scan" or precise microsurgery, the goal is always to protect your quality of life—your facial expression, your balance, and your overall well-being.

If you have been diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma or are worried about your symptoms, [book a consultation](/appointments) to discuss your options with a neurosurgeon.
