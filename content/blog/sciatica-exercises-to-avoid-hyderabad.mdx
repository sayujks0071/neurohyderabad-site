faq:
  - question: "Can I do yoga with sciatica?"
    answer: "Yes, but be careful. Avoid poses that require deep forward bending (like Forward Fold) or extreme twisting, as these can compress the sciatic nerve."
  - question: "Are hamstring stretches bad for sciatica?"
    answer: "Yes, standing hamstring stretches (bending forward to touch toes) can stretch the sciatic nerve itself, causing irritation. Lying down hamstring stretches are safer."
  - question: "Can I run on a treadmill with sciatica?"
    answer: "Running is high-impact and can aggravate sciatica. Walking or using an elliptical trainer is much safer during a flare-up."
  - question: "Is it better to sit or stand with sciatica?"
    answer: "Prolonged sitting is often worse than standing. Try to alternate positions every 20-30 minutes and use a lumbar support cushion."

## The "Good Intentions" Trap

When [sciatica](/conditions/sciatica-pain-treatment-hyderabad) strikes—that shooting pain from your lower back down your leg—the natural instinct is to "stretch it out." You might try to touch your toes or do some heavy squats to "strengthen the back."

Unfortunately, **many common exercises actually make sciatica worse.**

In my practice in Hyderabad, I often see patients who have aggravated a [mild disc bulge](/conditions/slip-disc-treatment-hyderabad) into a severe one simply by doing the wrong gym workouts or yoga poses. The sciatic nerve is sensitive; stretching it aggressively is like pulling on a tight rubber band—eventually, it snaps back with more pain.

Here are the **5 most common exercises you must avoid** if you have sciatica symptoms.

## 1. Standing Hamstring Stretch (Toe Touches)

This is the #1 mistake. When you stand and bend forward to touch your toes, you are not just stretching your hamstring muscles; you are putting massive tension on the **sciatic nerve** itself.

*   **Why it's bad:** It flexes the lumbar spine (rounding the back), which pushes the disc herniation further backward, pressing harder on the nerve.
*   **Do this instead:** **Lying Supine Hamstring Stretch.** Lie on your back, support your thigh with your hands, and gently straighten the knee. This keeps your back flat and safe.

## 2. Double Leg Lift (Leg Raises)

Often prescribed for "ab strength," lying on your back and lifting both legs up is a disaster for sciatica patients.

*   **Why it's bad:** The weight of your legs acts as a lever, pulling your pelvis and lower back into a strained arch. This puts immense pressure on the L4-L5 and L5-S1 discs.
*   **Do this instead:** **Single Leg Slide.** Keep one leg bent and slide the other heel along the floor. Or try the **Dead Bug** exercise for core stability without spine strain.

## 3. Heavy Deadlifts or Squats

If you are a gym-goer in Gachibowli or Jubilee Hills, you might be tempted to "push through the pain." **Don't.**

*   **Why it's bad:** Heavy axial loading (weight on the spine) compresses the discs. If a disc is already bulging, the added weight can cause it to rupture (extrude), leading to severe weakness or foot drop.
*   **Do this instead:** **Wall Sits** or **Glute Bridges**. These strengthen the legs and buttocks without compressing the spine vertically.

## 4. Bent-Over Rows

This exercise involves holding a barbell, bending forward at the waist, and pulling the weight up.

*   **Why it's bad:** Maintaining that bent-forward position places the highest possible load on your lumbar discs—even more than standing upright with the same weight. It creates a "shear force" that is dangerous for an unstable spine.
*   **Do this instead:** **Chest-Supported Rows** or **Lat Pulldowns**. Support your chest so your spine doesn't have to work overtime to hold you up.

## 5. High-Impact Cardio (Running/Jumping)

*   **Why it's bad:** Every time you land while running, force travels up your legs to your spine. Repeated impact on an inflamed nerve is a recipe for chronic pain.
*   **Do this instead:** **Elliptical Trainer** or **Swimming**. Water buoyancy removes gravity's compression, making swimming one of the best activities for spine health.

## When to Stop Exercise Completely?

While movement is medicine, you should stop immediately and see a spine specialist if you experience:
*   **Increased numbness or weakness** in the leg.
*   **Changes in bladder or bowel control** (This is an emergency).
*   **Pain that doesn't subside** after resting.

## Summary

Recovering from sciatica is about **smart movement**, not just *any* movement. By avoiding these 5 aggravating exercises, you allow the nerve inflammation to settle down.

If you are unsure which exercises are safe for your specific MRI report, it is best to consult a spine specialist or a neuro-rehabilitation expert. If symptoms persist despite precautions, consider scheduling a consultation to discuss [endoscopic treatment options](/services/minimally-invasive-spine-surgery).

*Patient results may vary. Always consult your surgeon for a timeline specific to your condition and procedure.*
