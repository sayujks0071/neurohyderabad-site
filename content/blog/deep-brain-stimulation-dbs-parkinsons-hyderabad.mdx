faq:
  - question: "How much does DBS surgery cost in Hyderabad?"
    answer: "The cost of DBS surgery in Hyderabad typically ranges from ₹15 Lakhs to ₹25 Lakhs. The price variation is largely due to the type of battery (IPG) chosen—rechargeable batteries are more expensive but last longer (15-20 years) compared to non-rechargeable ones (3-5 years)."
  - question: "Is DBS a cure for Parkinson's disease?"
    answer: "No, DBS is not a cure. It does not stop the progression of Parkinson's. However, it significantly reduces symptoms like tremors, stiffness, and slowness, allowing patients to reduce their medication dosage and improve their quality of life."
  - question: "Am I a good candidate for DBS?"
    answer: "You may be a candidate if you have had Parkinson's for at least 4-5 years, your symptoms respond to Levodopa but wear off quickly ('on-off' fluctuations), and you do not have significant memory problems or dementia."
  - question: "Is DBS surgery risky?"
    answer: "Like all brain surgeries, there are risks, including infection (3-5%), bleeding (1%), or hardware issues. However, with modern stereotactic navigation and experienced neurosurgeons, it is considered a safe and effective procedure."
  - question: "How long is the recovery after DBS surgery?"
    answer: "Most patients stay in the hospital for 2-3 days. The surgical wounds heal in about 10-14 days. The device is usually switched on ('programming') 2-3 weeks after surgery to allow swelling to subside."

## Key Takeaways
*   **Purpose:** DBS acts as a "pacemaker for the brain," using electrical pulses to control abnormal movements.
*   **Best For:** Patients whose medications are no longer working consistently or are causing severe side effects (dyskinesia).
*   **Cost Factor:** The primary cost driver is the imported battery/IPG device (Rechargeable vs. Non-rechargeable).
*   **Outcome:** Most patients see a 50-70% reduction in tremors and rigidity, often allowing for a reduction in oral medications.

## When Medications Are Not Enough

Parkinson's Disease is a progressive neurological condition. In the early stages, medications like Levodopa work wonders—patients feel normal. This is often called the "Honeymoon Period."

However, after 4-5 years, many patients in Hyderabad start to experience complications:
1.  **"Wearing Off":** The medication effect wears off before the next dose is due, leaving you stiff or slow.
2.  **"On-Off" Fluctuations:** You switch unpredictably between being mobile ("On") and being frozen ("Off").
3.  **Dyskinesia:** Uncontrolled, dance-like movements caused by high doses of medication.
4.  **Refractory Tremor:** Tremors that no longer respond well to pills.

If you are facing these challenges, **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)** might be the next step.
Many of our elderly patients also face co-occurring conditions like [sciatica](/conditions/sciatica-pain-treatment-hyderabad) or lumbar canal stenosis, which can complicate mobility. It is important to distinguish Parkinson's rigidity from spinal stiffness.

## What is Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)?

DBS is a surgical procedure where thin electrodes are implanted into specific areas of the brain (usually the Subthalamic Nucleus or STN) that control movement. These electrodes are connected by a wire running under the skin to a small battery pack (pulse generator) implanted in the chest—similar to a heart pacemaker.

**How it works:**
The device delivers continuous electrical pulses that block the abnormal signals causing tremors and stiffness. It effectively "resets" the brain's motor circuits, allowing for smoother movement.

## Are You a Candidate for DBS?

Not everyone with Parkinson's needs surgery. At our neurosurgery clinic in [Banjara Hills](/neurosurgeon-banjara-hills), we follow strict selection criteria to ensure the best outcomes:

**Ideal Candidates:**
*   Have had Parkinson's disease for at least **4 years**.
*   Respond well to Levodopa (this is the best predictor of success).
*   Suffer from "motor fluctuations" or dyskinesia.
*   Have disabling tremors even with medication.
*   Have **good cognitive function** (no dementia or severe memory loss).
*   Are generally healthy enough for surgery.

**Who is NOT a Candidate?**
*   Patients with "Parkinson's Plus" syndromes (like MSA or PSP).
*   Patients with significant dementia or depression.
*   Patients whose symptoms do not improve with Levodopa (except for tremor).

## The Procedure: A Step-by-Step Guide

DBS surgery is a precise, multi-stage procedure.

### Stage 1: Pre-operative Planning
We perform a high-resolution MRI of your brain to map the exact target. We use advanced software to plan a safe trajectory, avoiding critical blood vessels.

### Stage 2: Electrode Implantation (Brain Surgery)
This is often done as **[awake brain surgery](/blog/awake-craniotomy-guide)**.
*   A stereotactic frame is attached to your head to ensure sub-millimeter accuracy.
*   A small hole (burr hole) is made in the skull.
*   The electrode is lowered into the target.
*   **Why Awake?** We test the stimulation in real-time. We ask you to move your hand or speak to ensure the tremor stops and there are no side effects. This confirms the electrode is in the *perfect* spot.

### Stage 3: Battery Implantation
This is done under general anesthesia (you are asleep). The wires are tunnelled under the skin of your neck, and the battery (IPG) is placed in a small pocket under the skin of your chest, below the collarbone.

## Cost of DBS Surgery in Hyderabad

One of the most common questions I get is about the cost. DBS is an expensive procedure primarily because of the imported hardware.

**Estimated Cost Range: ₹15 Lakhs – ₹25 Lakhs**

**Breakdown:**
*   **Surgery & Hospital Charges:** ₹3 – ₹5 Lakhs (varies by hospital room category).
*   **DBS Implant Kit (The Device):** ₹12 – ₹20 Lakhs.

**Choosing the Right Battery:**
1.  **Non-Rechargeable (Primary Cell):** Cheaper upfront, but lasts only 3-5 years. Requires a minor surgery to replace the battery when it drains.
2.  **Rechargeable:** More expensive, but lasts **15-25 years**. You need to charge it wirelessly for about 30 minutes a week using a special collar. This is often the better long-term investment for younger patients.

*Note: Prices are estimates and subject to change. Insurance often covers the procedure, but coverage for the device itself varies by policy.*

## Recovery and Programming

*   **Hospital Stay:** Usually 2-3 days post-surgery.
*   **Suture Removal:** 10-14 days.
*   **Switching On:** We do not turn the device on immediately. We wait about 2-3 weeks for brain swelling to subside.
*   **Programming:** This is where the magic happens. You will come to the clinic for "programming sessions" where we adjust the frequency and voltage of the stimulation to maximize benefit and minimize side effects. It may take 3-6 months to find the optimal settings.

## Life After DBS: What Changes?

DBS is a commitment, but the rewards are significant. Here is what most patients experience:
*   **Medication Reduction:** Most patients can reduce their oral medications by 30-50%. This significantly reduces side effects like nausea and dyskinesia.
*   **Improved Sleep:** With less stiffness and tremor at night, sleep quality often improves dramatically.
*   **Activities of Daily Living:** Tasks like buttoning a shirt, writing, or holding a cup of tea become easier.

However, it is important to have realistic expectations. DBS helps with motor symptoms (tremor, stiffness, slowness) but does not typically improve balance, speech, or memory. For issues like walking difficulty due to nerve compression (foot drop), separate evaluation may be needed—read our [Foot Drop Recovery Guide](/blog/foot-drop-recovery-guide-hyderabad) for more details.

## Why Choose Hyderabad for DBS Surgery?

Hyderabad has emerged as a leading destination for functional neurosurgery in India.
*   **Cost Advantage:** The cost of DBS in Hyderabad is a fraction (often 1/10th) of the cost in the US or UK, with comparable quality of care.
*   **Expertise:** Our team is trained in advanced stereotactic and functional neurosurgery, handling complex cases including [brain tumor surgeries](/services/brain-tumor-surgery-hyderabad) and epilepsy surgeries.
*   **Technology:** We use the latest navigational systems and FDA-approved implants (Medtronic, Abbott, Boston Scientific).

## Conclusion

Deep Brain Stimulation is not a magic cure, but for the right patient, it is life-changing. It can turn the clock back by 5-10 years, allowing you to walk, eat, and live independently again.

If you or a loved one in Hyderabad is struggling with advanced Parkinson's, do not lose hope. Technology has advanced significantly.
