faq:
  - question: "What does a brain aneurysm headache feel like?"
    answer: "A ruptured brain aneurysm causes a 'thunderclap headache'—a sudden, blinding pain that reaches maximum intensity within seconds. Patients often describe it as the 'worst headache of their life.'"
  - question: "Can a migraine cause a brain aneurysm?"
    answer: "No, migraines do not cause aneurysms. However, people with migraines can also have aneurysms. The key is to notice if your headache pattern changes drastically."
  - question: "What is the main difference between migraine and aneurysm pain?"
    answer: "Migraines usually build up gradually (minutes to hours) and throb. Aneurysm ruptures strike instantly like a physical blow to the head."
  - question: "Is a brain aneurysm always fatal?"
    answer: "Not always, but it is a medical emergency. Immediate treatment (clipping or coiling) significantly improves survival and recovery chances. Delaying care increases the risk of permanent damage."
  - question: "Who is at risk for brain aneurysms?"
    answer: "Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, family history, and age (over 40). Women are slightly more prone to aneurysms than men."

## Key Takeaways
*   **Speed of Onset:** Migraines build up; aneurysm ruptures strike instantly ("thunderclap").
*   **Intensity:** Aneurysm pain is often described as the "worst headache of your life."
*   **Associated Symptoms:** Stiff neck, seizure, or loss of consciousness strongly suggest an aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage).
*   **Action Plan:** If you experience a sudden, severe headache unlike anything before, call for an ambulance or rush to the nearest stroke-ready hospital in Hyderabad immediately.
*   **Treatment:** Unruptured aneurysms can be treated preventively with coiling or clipping to prevent bleeding.

## Is it just a migraine, or something worse?

Headaches are extremely common. In a busy city like Hyderabad, stress, traffic, and long working hours trigger tension headaches and migraines for thousands of people daily. Most of the time, a headache is painful but not dangerous.

However, there is one specific type of headache that acts as a siren for a life-threatening emergency: the rupture of a **brain aneurysm**.

A brain aneurysm is a weak, bulging spot on the wall of a brain artery—like a balloon on a garden hose. If it bursts, it causes bleeding into the space around the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage), which can be fatal if not treated immediately.

Distinguishing between a severe migraine and a ruptured aneurysm can save a life.

## The "Thunderclap" Headache: The #1 Warning Sign

The most critical difference is **speed**.

*   **Migraine:** Typically starts as a dull ache or visual disturbance (aura) and gradually intensifies over 30 minutes to a few hours. You can often feel it coming.
*   **Aneurysm Rupture:** Hits you instantly. One second you are fine, the next second you are in agonizing pain. This is called a **Thunderclap Headache**. It reaches peak intensity within 60 seconds.

**Patient Description:** "It felt like someone hit me in the back of the head with a cricket bat."

## Comparison: Migraine vs. Aneurysm Rupture

| Feature | Migraine | Aneurysm Rupture (Emergency) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Gradual (minutes to hours) | Sudden, instant (seconds) |
| **Pain Quality** | Throbbing, pulsating | Explosive, blinding pressure |
| **Duration** | Hours to days | Constant, unrelenting |
| **Neck Stiffness** | Rare | Common (nuchal rigidity) |
| **Vomiting** | Common | Common (often projectile) |
| **Consciousness** | Alert (but wants to sleep) | May faint, seizure, or be confused |
| **Triggers** | Stress, food, lack of sleep | Spontaneous or during exertion (lifting, straining) |

## Other "Red Flag" Symptoms

Beyond the headache itself, a ruptured aneurysm often presents with symptoms that indicate pressure on the brain or irritation of the brain covering (meninges):

1.  **Stiff Neck:** You cannot touch your chin to your chest due to severe pain and stiffness.
2.  **Vision Changes:** Double vision (diplopia) or a drooping eyelid (ptosis) can occur if the aneurysm presses on a nerve.
3.  **Seizures:** Sudden convulsions in a person with no history of epilepsy.
4.  **Confusion or Drowsiness:** The person may not know where they are or may be difficult to wake up.

## What causes a Brain Aneurysm?

While the exact cause isn't always clear, certain factors weaken the artery walls over time:
*   **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension):** The most common manageable risk factor.
*   **Smoking:** significantly damages blood vessel walls.
*   **Family History:** Genetics play a role. If two first-degree relatives had aneurysms, screening is recommended.
*   **Age:** More common after 40.

## Diagnosis and Treatment in Hyderabad

If you arrive at the emergency room with a thunderclap headache, we immediately perform a **CT Scan**. This can detect bleeding in the brain in seconds. If the CT is negative but suspicion remains high, a **Lumbar Puncture** (spinal tap) may be done to look for blood in the spinal fluid.

To find the exact location of the aneurysm, we use **CT Angiography (CTA)** or **Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)**—the gold standard. (See our guide on [neuro-imaging reports](/blog/understanding-brain-mri-tumor-report-guide) to understand your scans).

### Treatment Options

If an aneurysm is found (ruptured or unruptured), the goal is to stop blood flow into it. As a neurosurgeon, I perform two main types of procedures:

1.  **Surgical Clipping:** An open surgery where a small metal clip is placed at the neck of the aneurysm to seal it off. This is a durable, long-term cure.
2.  **Endovascular Coiling:** A minimally invasive procedure. A catheter is guided from the groin up to the brain arteries, and soft platinum coils are packed into the aneurysm to induce clotting.

The choice depends on the aneurysm's shape, location, and the patient's condition.

## When to seek urgent care?

**Do not wait.** If you or a family member experiences a sudden, explosive headache—especially if accompanied by a stiff neck, passing out, or seizure—**call for an ambulance or go to the nearest major hospital immediately.**

Time is brain. Fast treatment prevents re-bleeding and vasospasm ([stroke](/blog/world-stroke-day-2025-hyderabad-stroke-code)), which are the main causes of disability after a rupture.

For **unruptured aneurysms** (often found incidentally on [MRI scans](/blog/understanding-brain-mri-tumor-report-guide) for headaches), the situation is less urgent but requires expert evaluation. We assess the risk of rupture based on size and location to decide if preventive treatment is needed.

If you are worried about [chronic headaches](/blog/headache-vs-brain-tumor-warning-signs) or have a family history of aneurysms, [book a consultation](/appointments) for a screening and peace of mind.
