faq:
  - question: "Is this brain surgery really done through the nose?"
    answer: "Yes. Using a thin tube with a camera (endoscope), we access the pituitary gland through the nostrils and sphenoid sinus. There are no cuts on the face or head."
  - question: "How long is the hospital stay?"
    answer: "Most patients are discharged in 3-4 days. This is significantly shorter than open skull surgery (craniotomy) which may require a week."
  - question: "Will I lose my sense of smell?"
    answer: "Temporary congestion is common for 2-3 weeks, but permanent loss of smell is very rare with modern endoscopic techniques."
  - question: "What are the risks of this surgery?"
    answer: "Major risks are rare but include CSF leak (fluid from nose), hormonal imbalance (needing medication), or bleeding. We use advanced sealing techniques to prevent leaks."
  - question: "How much does pituitary tumor surgery cost in Hyderabad?"
    answer: "The cost generally ranges from ₹2.5 Lakhs to ₹4 Lakhs depending on tumor size, hospital room category, and insurance coverage. It covers surgery, anesthesia, and hospital stay."

## "Brain Surgery Without a Scar?"

When I tell patients diagnosed with a **Pituitary Adenoma** that we can remove their tumor without a single cut on their head, they often look in disbelief. "Doctor, how can you reach the brain without opening the skull?"

The answer lies in **Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery**—a minimally invasive technique that has revolutionized neurosurgery. By using the natural corridor of the nose, we can access the pituitary gland (located at the base of the brain) directly, avoiding the need to retract or cut through normal brain tissue.

At our center in Hyderabad, this is now the **gold standard** for treating most pituitary tumors.

## What is a Pituitary Adenoma?

The pituitary gland is often called the "Master Gland" because it controls hormones for growth, metabolism, and reproduction. It sits in a small bony saddle (sella turcica) just behind your eyes and nose.

**Common Symptoms of a Tumor Here:**
*   **Vision Loss:** Tunnel vision (bumping into door frames) because the tumor pushes on optic nerves.
*   **Hormonal Imbalance:** Unexplained weight gain, milk discharge (galactorrhea), or menstrual irregularities.
*   **Headaches:** Deep, dull headaches behind the eyes. (See our guide on [Headache vs. Brain Tumor Warnings](/blog/headache-vs-brain-tumor-warning-signs)).

## Diagnosis: How Do We Confirm?

Before we discuss surgery, precise diagnosis is critical. In Hyderabad, we use a combination of advanced imaging and lab tests:

1.  **MRI Brain with Contrast (Pituitary Protocol):** A standard MRI is often not enough. We need a "dynamic contrast" study to see micro-adenomas (tumors smaller than 10mm).
2.  **Visual Field Test (Perimetry):** Since the optic nerves are right above the gland, we check for "bitemporal hemianopsia"—loss of side vision.
3.  **Hormonal Panel:** We check Prolactin, Cortisol, TSH, and Growth Hormone levels. This tells us if the tumor is "functioning" (secreting excess hormones) or "non-functioning."

## The Procedure: How We Do It

We perform this surgery at [Yashoda Hospital, Malakpet](/services/brain-tumor-surgery-hyderabad), using high-definition 4K Endoscopes and Neuronavigation (GPS for the brain).

### Step 1: The Approach
You are under general anesthesia. We insert a thin endoscope (4mm wide) into one nostril. We gently move the nasal tissues aside to reach the back of the nasal cavity.

### Step 2: Reaching the Tumor
We make a tiny opening in the thin bone (sphenoid sinus) to reveal the pituitary gland. There is **no brain retraction** involved.

### Step 3: Removing the Tumor
Using micro-instruments, we carefully core out the tumor piece by piece. The high-resolution camera allows us to see the difference between the tumor and the normal gland clearly, preserving your hormonal function.

### Step 4: Closing Up
Once the tumor is removed, we seal the opening using a small piece of fat (taken from your belly or thigh) or specialized glue to prevent spinal fluid leakage. No nasal packing is usually needed, so you breathe comfortably post-op.

## Why Choose Endoscopic Surgery?

Comparing the modern "Through the Nose" approach vs. the traditional "Open Skull" (Craniotomy):

| Feature | Endoscopic (Transsphenoidal) | Traditional Craniotomy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Incision** | None (Internal) | Large scalp incision |
| **Brain Retraction** | None | Yes (Risk of brain swelling) |
| **Hospital Stay** | 3-4 Days | 5-7 Days |
| **Pain** | Mild headache/congestion | Significant headache |
| **Recovery** | 2-3 Weeks | 6-8 Weeks |
| **Cosmesis** | No scar | Visible scar/hair shaved |

## Non-Surgical Options: Is Surgery Always Needed?

Not every pituitary tumor needs surgery.
*   **Prolactinomas:** Tumors that secrete prolactin can often be "melted away" with medication (Cabergoline). We confirm this with a blood test before planning any surgery.
*   **Small, Asymptomatic Tumors:** If the tumor is small and not pressing on the optic nerves, we may just monitor it with yearly MRIs.
*   **Gamma Knife Radiosurgery:** For small remnants or patients unfit for surgery, focused radiation can stop tumor growth.

## Recovery Timeline in Hyderabad

Many of our patients from Secunderabad and Gachibowli worry about taking long leave from work. Here is a typical timeline:

*   **Hospital Stay (Day 1-3):** You are monitored in the ICU for 24 hours to check vision and hormone levels. You are shifted to the ward on Day 2.
*   **Discharge (Day 3-4):** You go home. You might feel like you have a bad cold or sinusitis.
*   **First Week:** Rest at home. Avoid blowing your nose forcefully.
*   **Week 2:** Nasal crusting clears up. Vision improvement is often noticed immediately.
*   **Return to Work:** Desk jobs can be resumed in 2-3 weeks.

## Risks and "Red Flags"

While highly safe, no surgery is risk-free.
*   **CSF Leak:** In <5% of cases, clear fluid may drip from the nose. This may require a lumbar drain or minor revision.
*   **Diabetes Insipidus:** Excessive urination due to temporary hormone disturbance. Usually resolves in days.

**Seek Urgent Care If:**
*   You have a sudden burst of clear watery fluid from the nose.
*   You develop a high fever (>101°F) with neck stiffness.
*   Your vision suddenly worsens.

## Cost of Pituitary Surgery in Hyderabad

We believe in transparency. The cost typically ranges from **₹2.5 Lakhs to ₹4 Lakhs**.
This variation depends on:
1.  **Room Type:** General Ward vs. Private Room.
2.  **Technology:** Use of specialized Neuronavigation or Intraoperative MRI.
3.  **Implants:** Specialized glues or meshes for skull base repair.
*Most insurance policies (corporate and private) cover this procedure fully.*

## Summary

If you have been diagnosed with a pituitary tumor, the fear of "brain surgery" is natural. But understand that technology has moved from "opening the head" to "entering through the nose."

At our [Brain Tumor Clinic](/services/brain-tumor-surgery-hyderabad), we specialize in preserving your **Quality of Life**—saving your vision and hormones without the trauma of open surgery.
