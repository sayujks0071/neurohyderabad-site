faq:
  - question: "What is the success rate of endoscopic surgery for sciatica?"
    answer: "Clinical studies and our own patient data show a success rate of over 90% for properly selected patients. Most patients experience immediate leg pain relief after the procedure."
  - question: "Will my sciatica come back after surgery?"
    answer: "The risk of recurrence (re-herniation) is low, typically around 3-5%. Maintaining a healthy weight and following our core strengthening protocol significantly reduces this risk."
  - question: "How soon can I walk after endoscopic sciatica surgery?"
    answer: "Almost immediately. We encourage patients to walk within 2-3 hours of the surgery. Most patients are discharged home on the same day or the next morning."
  - question: "Is endoscopic surgery safer than open surgery?"
    answer: "Yes. Because it uses a tiny 8mm incision and does not cut muscle or remove bone, there is significantly less blood loss, lower infection risk, and faster recovery compared to traditional open laminectomy."

## The Big Question: Will Surgery Actually Fix My Pain?

If you are reading this, you are likely part of the 10% of [sciatica patients](/conditions/sciatica-pain-treatment-hyderabad) who didn't get better with rest, painkillers, and physiotherapy. You are tired of the shooting leg pain, the numbness, and the inability to sit or stand for long.

Your doctor might have mentioned "surgery," and naturally, you are worried. *Will it work? Is it risky? Will I be bedridden?*

In Hyderabad, I encounter these questions daily. The good news is that spine surgery has evolved. We no longer need to make large cuts or keep you in bed for weeks. **[Endoscopic Spine Surgery](/services/endoscopic-spine-surgery-hyderabad)** has changed the game.

## Short Answer: Yes, it works (for the right patient).

For patients with a confirmed herniated disc (slip disc) compressing the nerve root, **Endoscopic Discectomy** has a **success rate of over 90%**.

Success in this context means:
*   **Immediate relief** from the shooting leg pain (sciatica).
*   **Return to normal activities** within weeks, not months.
*   **Minimal reliance** on painkillers post-surgery.

## How is Endoscopic Surgery Different?

Traditional "open" spine surgery involves a large incision (3-5 inches), cutting through back muscles, and often removing bone to get to the nerve. This causes significant post-operative pain and stiffness.

**Endoscopic Spine Surgery (Keyhole Surgery)** is different:
*   **Incision:** Tiny, about 7-8mm (size of a pencil eraser).
*   **Muscle:** We dilate (spread) the muscle fibers instead of cutting them.
*   **Vision:** A high-definition 4K camera enters the spine, giving us a magnified view of the nerve.
*   **Precision:** We use micro-instruments to remove *only* the disc fragment pressing on the nerve, leaving the healthy disc and spine stability intact.

## Who is the "Right" Candidate?

Surgery is not for everyone. You are a good candidate if:
1.  **MRI Confirmation:** Your MRI shows a clear disc herniation compressing the nerve.
2.  **failed Conservative Care:** You have tried medicines and physio for 6 weeks without relief.
3.  **Neurological Deficit:** You have weakness (foot drop) or worsening numbness (this might require urgent surgery).
4.  **Sciatica Dominance:** You have more *leg pain* than *back pain*.

## The Recovery Timeline: What to Expect

One of the biggest advantages of endoscopic surgery is the recovery speed. Unlike open surgery, you are up and moving almost immediately.

| Timeline | Activity Level | Restrictions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 0 (Surgery)** | Walk within 3-4 hours. Discharge same day or next morning. | Avoid bending forward or twisting the spine. |
| **Week 1** | Light walking inside home. Can climb stairs if necessary. | No lifting >2kg. No driving. |
| **Week 2-3** | Return to desk job (WFH preferred initially). Drive short distances. | Take standing breaks every 45 mins. |
| **Week 6** | Resume gym, swimming, and longer drives. | Focus on core strengthening. |
| **Month 3** | Full return to sports and heavy activities. | None (maintain good posture). |

## Is it Safer than Open Surgery?

Yes, specifically for elderly patients or those with diabetes/hypertension, endoscopic surgery is safer because:
*   **Local/Regional Anesthesia:** Often done while you are awake or under light sedation, avoiding general anesthesia risks.
*   **Less Infection Risk:** The tiny incision and constant water irrigation during surgery wash away bacteria.
*   **Less Blood Loss:** Minimal to negligible blood loss.

## Conclusion

If you have been suffering from sciatica that won't go away, fear of surgery shouldn't stop you from getting your life back. Endoscopic spine surgery offers a safe, highly effective, and quick solution to relieve nerve pressure and eliminate pain.
