faq:
  - question: "Is Acoustic Neuroma cancerous?"
    answer: "No. Acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas) are benign, non-cancerous tumors. They do not spread to other parts of the body, but they can grow and press on critical brain structures, requiring treatment."
  - question: "Can hearing be restored after surgery?"
    answer: "Hearing preservation depends on the tumor's size and your hearing level before surgery. If hearing is already lost, it usually cannot be restored. The goal is often to preserve whatever hearing remains."
  - question: "What is the difference between Microsurgery and Gamma Knife?"
    answer: "Microsurgery removes the tumor physically and is often preferred for larger tumors. Gamma Knife (Radiosurgery) uses focused radiation to stop the tumor from growing and is ideal for small tumors or older patients."
  - question: "Will I have facial paralysis after surgery?"
    answer: "Facial nerve preservation is a top priority. With modern intraoperative nerve monitoring, the risk of permanent facial paralysis is significantly reduced, especially in experienced hands."
  - question: "How long does recovery take?"
    answer: "After microsurgery, most patients spend 3-5 days in the hospital and return to normal activities within 4-6 weeks. Radiosurgery is a day-care procedure with almost immediate recovery."

## Key Takeaways
*   **Benign Nature:** Acoustic Neuromas are slow-growing, benign tumors on the balance nerve, not brain cancer.
*   **Early Signs:** Unilateral (one-sided) hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing) are the most common early warning signs.
*   **Treatment Triad:** The three main options are Observation (Watch & Wait), Microsurgery, and Stereotactic Radiosurgery (Gamma Knife/CyberKnife).
*   **Facial Nerve:** Preserving the facial nerve (which controls expression) is the most critical aspect of surgery.
*   **Balance Issues:** Balance problems are common but often improve as the brain compensates over time.

## "I can hear fine in my left ear, but my right ear is ringing..."

This is the classic story of a patient with an **Acoustic Neuroma** (also known scientifically as a **Vestibular Schwannoma**). Unlike other brain tumors that might cause headaches or seizures, this tumor often announces itself with silence—a gradual fading of hearing in just one ear.

In my neurosurgery practice in Hyderabad, I often see patients who have ignored this symptom for years, assuming it was just "aging" or "wax blockage."

This guide will help you understand what this diagnosis means, why it happens, and how we treat it with modern techniques that prioritize your quality of life.

## What is an Acoustic Neuroma?

An Acoustic Neuroma is a **benign (non-cancerous)** tumor. It does not invade the brain tissue itself; rather, it grows on the **8th Cranial Nerve** (the Vestibulocochlear nerve). This nerve runs from your brainstem to your ear and has two functions:
1.  Transmitting sound (Hearing).
2.  Transmitting balance information (Equilibrium).

The tumor arises from "Schwann cells," which form the insulation around the nerve—hence the name *Vestibular Schwannoma*. Because it grows in a tight bony channel (the internal auditory canal) and the space between the brainstem and skull (cerebellopontine angle), even a small growth can cause significant symptoms.

## Symptoms: The "Unilateral" Red Flag

The hallmark of this condition is asymmetry. Since the tumor usually affects only one nerve, symptoms appear on **one side only**.

### 1. Hearing Loss (90% of patients)
This is usually gradual and progressive. You might notice difficulty understanding speech on the phone with that ear, or trouble hearing in a crowded room. Sudden hearing loss can also occur but is less common.

### 2. Tinnitus (Ringing in the Ear)
A constant ringing, buzzing, or hissing sound in the affected ear. Tinnitus without hearing loss can be an early sign.

### 3. Balance Issues (Vertigo)
Since the tumor grows on the balance nerve, you might feel unsteady or "drunk" when walking. True spinning vertigo is rare because the tumor grows slowly, allowing the brain to compensate.

### 4. Facial Numbness
As the tumor grows larger, it can press on the nearby **Trigeminal Nerve** (5th nerve), causing numbness or tingling on the face (cheek or jaw). This is often mistaken for a dental issue.

## Diagnosis: The MRI Confirmation

If you have one-sided hearing loss, a standard hearing test (Audiometry) is the first step. If the test shows "sensorineural hearing loss" that is worse in one ear, an **MRI with Contrast** is mandatory.

An MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is the gold standard. It can detect tumors as small as 1-2 millimeters. (See our guide on [Understanding MRI Reports](/blog/understanding-brain-mri-tumor-report-guide) for more on this).

## Treatment Options: The "Three O's"

Once diagnosed, the decision to treat depends on three factors:
1.  **Size** of the tumor.
2.  **Age** and health of the patient.
3.  **Hearing status** (Is hearing still useful?).

### 1. Observation (Watch and Wait)
Since these tumors are benign and slow-growing (often 1-2mm per year), we don't always need to rush.
*   **Who is this for?** Elderly patients, very small tumors (<1.5cm) with no symptoms other than hearing loss, or patients with serious medical conditions.
*   **Protocol:** We repeat the MRI every 6-12 months. If it doesn't grow, we leave it alone.

### 2. Microsurgery (Surgical Removal)
Surgery is the only way to *remove* the tumor.
*   **Who is this for?** Large tumors compressing the brainstem, young patients, or tumors that are growing rapidly.
*   **The Goal:** Total removal while preserving the **Facial Nerve**. The facial nerve runs right next to the tumor. Damaging it causes facial paralysis (drooping face).
*   **Monitoring:** We use continuous **intraoperative nerve monitoring** to test the facial nerve throughout the surgery, ensuring its safety.

**Surgical Approaches:**
*   **Retrosigmoid:** Behind the ear. Good for hearing preservation.
*   **Translabyrinthine:** Through the ear bone. Best for facial nerve safety but sacrifices any remaining hearing (used if hearing is already lost).

### 3. Stereotactic Radiosurgery (Gamma Knife / CyberKnife)
This is a non-invasive option that uses focused radiation beams to stop the tumor's growth. It kills the DNA of the tumor cells so they can't divide.
*   **Who is this for?** Small to medium tumors (<3cm), older patients, or those who cannot undergo surgery.
*   **Pros:** Day-care procedure, no incision, no hospital stay.
*   **Cons:** The tumor doesn't disappear; it just stops growing (and may shrink slightly over years).

## Facial Nerve Preservation: Our Top Priority

The biggest fear patients have is waking up with a crooked face. In modern [brain tumor surgery](/services/brain-tumor-surgery-hyderabad), preserving facial function is our primary metric of success, even ahead of total tumor removal.

If a tumor is very sticky or adherent to the facial nerve, I may choose to leave a tiny sliver of tumor behind rather than risk cutting the nerve. This remnant can be watched or treated with radiation later. This strategy ("Near-Total Resection") ensures you keep your smile.

## Recovery and Outlook

*   **Hospital Stay:** 3-5 days for surgery.
*   **Balance:** You may feel dizzy for a few days as your other ear takes over the balance function. Physical therapy helps speed this up.
*   **Headache:** Mild headaches are common but resolve within weeks.

An Acoustic Neuroma diagnosis is life-changing, but it is not a death sentence. It is a manageable condition with excellent outcomes in expert hands.

## When to Seek Help

If you have:
*   Hearing loss in **one ear only**.
*   Ringing (tinnitus) that won't go away.
*   Unexplained unsteadiness.

Please schedule a consultation. Early detection means smaller tumors, which means significantly better chances of saving your hearing and your facial function.
