faq:
  - question: "Is Glioblastoma curable?"
    answer: "Currently, Glioblastoma is not considered curable, but it is treatable. The goal of treatment (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy) is to prolong life, preserve quality of life, and manage symptoms. Long-term survivors exist, though they are rare."
  - question: "What is the life expectancy with GBM?"
    answer: "Median survival is typically 12-15 months with standard treatment. However, individual outcomes vary significantly based on age, tumor genetics (MGMT promoter methylation), and the extent of surgical resection."
  - question: "Can surgery remove the entire tumor?"
    answer: "Complete removal is often impossible because GBM invades surrounding brain tissue like tentacle-like roots. However, 'maximal safe resection' aims to remove as much as possible without damaging critical brain functions."
  - question: "What is Awake Craniotomy for GBM?"
    answer: "For tumors near speech or motor areas, an awake craniotomy allows the surgeon to map the brain while the patient is awake. This ensures the tumor is removed while preserving essential functions like speaking and moving."
  - question: "Why choose Dr. Sayuj Krishnan for GBM surgery?"
    answer: "Dr. Sayuj specializes in advanced neuro-oncology techniques, including fluorescence-guided surgery (5-ALA) and awake craniotomy, to safely maximize tumor removal, which is the most critical factor for survival."

## Key Takeaways
*   **Aggressive Nature:** Glioblastoma (GBM) is a Grade 4 brain tumor requiring immediate and aggressive multi-modal treatment.
*   **Standard of Care:** The "Stupp Protocol" (Surgery + Radiation + Chemotherapy) is the gold standard for treatment globally and in Hyderabad.
*   **Role of Surgery:** Maximal safe resection is the single most important factor in improving survival. Techniques like [Awake Craniotomy](/blog/awake-craniotomy-brain-tumor-guide) help achieve this safely.
*   **Symptoms:** Headaches that worsen in the morning, seizures, and sudden personality changes are key warning signs.
*   **Hope exists:** While the diagnosis is devastating, advancements in surgical technology and personalized medicine are improving outcomes.

## A Diagnosis No One Wants to Hear

Hearing the words "Glioblastoma Multiforme" or "GBM" is a life-altering moment for patients and their families. It is the most common and most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in adults. In Hyderabad, I frequently see families overwhelmed by this diagnosis, frantically searching for answers, timelines, and hope.

This guide is designed to cut through the noise. It provides a clear, medical overview of what GBM is, how we treat it at our neurosurgery center in Hyderabad, and what you can expect during this difficult journey.

## What is Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)?

Glioblastoma is a type of astrocytoma, a tumor that arises from star-shaped cells (astrocytes) that support nerve cells. Under the WHO classification, it is a **Grade 4** tumor, meaning it grows rapidly and spreads into nearby brain tissue.

Unlike benign tumors that have clear borders (like a ball), GBM grows like a plant with roots, sending microscopic tentacles into the healthy brain. This is why it is almost impossible to remove *every* single cell surgically, and why follow-up radiation and chemotherapy are essential.

## Recognizing the Symptoms

Symptoms of GBM depend largely on *where* the tumor is located in the brain. Because these tumors grow quickly, symptoms often develop over days or weeks.

### Common Warning Signs:
*   **Persistent Headaches:** Often worse in the morning or when bending over. These are not your typical stress headaches.
*   **Seizures:** A sudden onset of seizures in an adult with no history of epilepsy is a major red flag.
*   **Cognitive & Personality Changes:** Confusion, memory loss, or sudden shifts in behavior (e.g., apathy or aggression).
*   **Focal Neurological Deficits:** Weakness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking (aphasia), or vision loss.
*   **Nausea and Vomiting:** Caused by increased pressure inside the skull.

If you or a loved one experiences these symptoms, an MRI is needed immediately. (Read our guide on [Understanding Brain MRI Reports](/blog/understanding-brain-mri-tumor-report-guide) for more details).

## How is GBM Diagnosed?

1.  **MRI Scan:** A contrast-enhanced MRI is the gold standard. GBM typically appears as a "ring-enhancing lesion"—a bright ring surrounding a dark, necrotic (dead) center.
2.  **Biopsy/Resection:** The definitive diagnosis can only be made by examining tumor tissue under a microscope. This is usually done during the surgery to remove the tumor.
3.  **Molecular Testing:** Pathologists now test for specific genetic markers (like *IDH mutation* and *MGMT promoter methylation*). These markers help predict how well the tumor will respond to chemotherapy and radiation.

## The Standard of Care: The Stupp Protocol

Treatment for GBM is complex and requires a multidisciplinary team. In Hyderabad, we follow the international **Stupp Protocol**, which involves three phases:

### Phase 1: Maximal Safe Surgical Resection
The neurosurgeon's goal is to remove as much of the tumor as safely possible.
*   **Why it matters:** Studies show that removing >98% of the visible tumor significantly improves survival.
*   **Advanced Techniques:**
    *   **Neuronavigation:** Like a GPS for the brain to guide the surgeon.
    *   **5-ALA Fluorescence:** A dye given before surgery makes tumor cells glow pink under blue light, helping the surgeon distinguish tumor from healthy brain.
    *   **[Awake Craniotomy](/blog/awake-craniotomy-brain-tumor-guide):** Used when the tumor is near critical areas for speech or movement.

For more details on our surgical capabilities, see our **[Brain Tumor Surgery](/services/brain-tumor-surgery-hyderabad)** service page.

### Phase 2: Concurrent Chemoradiation
About 2-4 weeks after surgery, patients begin a 6-week course of:
*   **Radiation Therapy:** Targeted beams to kill remaining tumor cells.
*   **Chemotherapy:** An oral pill called **Temozolomide** taken daily.

### Phase 3: Adjuvant Chemotherapy
After a rest period, patients continue taking Temozolomide for 5 days every month for 6-12 months.

## Survival and Prognosis

I believe in being honest with my patients while maintaining hope. Glioblastoma is a challenging disease.
*   **Median Survival:** Without treatment, survival is often only a few months. With aggressive standard treatment, median survival is approximately 12-15 months.
*   **Long-term Survivors:** Some patients (about 5-10%) survive for 5 years or more. Factors favoring better survival include:
    *   Younger age (<50 years).
    *   High "performance status" (ability to function independently).
    *   **MGMT Methylation:** A genetic marker that makes the tumor more sensitive to chemotherapy.
    *   **Gross Total Resection:** Complete removal of the visible tumor.

## Why Choose a Specialist in Hyderabad?

Treating GBM requires more than just a surgeon; it requires a system.
*   **Tumor Board:** At our center, difficult cases are discussed by a team of neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists to plan the best course of action.
*   **Technology:** Access to intraoperative MRI, 5-ALA fluorescence, and awake craniotomy capabilities is crucial for safe, aggressive resection.
*   **Compassionate Care:** We understand the emotional toll of this diagnosis. We provide support not just for the patient, but for the entire family.

## When to Seek Urgent Care

GBM can cause rapid deterioration. Go to the ER immediately if the patient experiences:
*   Continuous, uncontrollable seizures (Status Epilepticus).
*   Sudden unresponsiveness or difficulty waking up.
*   Severe headache with projectile vomiting.

## Summary

A Glioblastoma diagnosis is overwhelming, but you do not have to face it alone. Immediate, aggressive surgical intervention followed by comprehensive oncological care offers the best chance for extending life and preserving quality time with loved ones.

If you suspect a brain tumor or have received a diagnosis and need a second opinion on surgical options, please **[book a consultation](/appointments)**. Time is of the essence in treating GBM.
