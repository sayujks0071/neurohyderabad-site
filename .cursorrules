# Cursor Rules for Neurohyderabad Site

## MCP Server Configuration
The project uses two MCP servers:
- **Playwright** - For browser automation and testing
- **Figma** - For design-to-code workflow
Configuration is stored in `~/.cursor/mcp.json` and can be set up using `npm run setup:cursor-mcp`.

## Project Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow Next.js 15 App Router conventions
- Maintain SEO best practices (E-E-A-T components)

- Validate blog posts before creation

## Blog Workflow
- Never create blog posts with "example", "test", "draft", "sample", "template", or "placeholder" in the slug or title
- Use `npm run blog:validate` before creating new blog posts
- Use `npm run blog:remove-examples` to check for and remove example posts
