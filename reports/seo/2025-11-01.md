# Daily SEO Report ? 2025-11-01

## Sitewide Scores
Lighthouse numeric scores for homepage (mobile / desktop) will be populated by the CI runner (lhci) during branch build.

## Core Findings
- Structured medical schema for Dr. Sayuj Krishnan is not embedded as JSON-LD on the homepage. We'll add `Physician` schema with specialties (endoscopic spine surgery, awake neurosurgery, epilepsy surgery) and hospital affiliation at Yashoda Hospital Malakpet, Hyderabad.  
- No guaranteed global `<title>`, `<meta description>`, Open Graph, or Twitter metadata across all pages. We'll introduce `next-seo` with a central config.
- We observed apex `drsayuj.info` resolving to `www.drsayuj.info`, which is correct. We'll codify this redirect in `next.config.js` for safety.
- `robots.txt` allows crawling of real content and blocks internal/test routes. It also declares the sitemap. We'll check in an equivalent `next-sitemap.config.js` so sitemap/robots are produced consistently in every build.
- Performance: Hero and treatment sections appear image- and content-heavy. We will enforce AVIF/WebP output, long-lived cache headers, font preconnect, and lazy loading to improve LCP / INP on mobile.

## Impact vs Effort
**High impact / low effort**
- Add `next-seo` default config + `<DefaultSeo />`.
- Add `Physician` JSON-LD component.
- Add redirect + cache headers in `next.config.js`.

**High impact / medium effort**
- Convert images to `<Image />` with modern formats.
- Add social preview image `public/og-default.png`.

**Medium impact / low effort**
- Make sure sitemap and robots are generated at build with `next-sitemap`, matching current live directives.

## Non-indexable / blocked areas
- /drafts, /api, /auth, /test-* and similar routes are intentionally disallowed in robots.txt. Nothing critical to patients is blocked.

## Broken internal links / 404s
- Not evaluated yet. TODO: run broken-link-checker in CI against URLs pulled from sitemap.

## Core Web Vitals trend
- Baseline run. No historical comparison yet.
