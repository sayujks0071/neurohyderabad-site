  "impact": {
    "rationale": "Breaking up the hydration and execution of multiple third-party scripts (analytics, chat widget) into two phases reduces the main thread blocking time (TBT) during the critical first few seconds of page load. This lowers the risk of INP issues when users attempt to interact early.",

      "note": "Lab data (Lighthouse) shows stable scores. Real-world impact on INP is expected to be positive due to reduced main thread contention."

      "Observe that ClientAnalytics.tsx logic now includes a 2.5s delay for 'heavy' scripts."
