    "description": "Change `font-display` from `optional` to `swap` in `app/layout.tsx`.",
    "rationale": "Improves LCP by showing fallback text immediately (vs blocking for up to 100ms). Improves UX by ensuring custom font eventually loads. CLS risk is mitigated by `next/font` fallback metric overrides.",
    "verification_plan": "Run `pnpm build` and `pnpm lint` to ensure stability."

    "status": "Success",
    "details": "Build passed successfully. Fixed unrelated build errors in `app/page.tsx` (duplicate import), `app/api/ai-booking/route.ts` (duplicate identifier), `app/api/ai/summarize/route.ts` (implicit any, jsdom types), `components/TeleconsultationForm.tsx` (missing argument), `src/components/AppointmentFormTracker.tsx` (argument type), and `app/_components/Button.tsx` (prop spread types).",
    "expected_impact": "Text should now be visible immediately on load (fallback font), improving LCP. Custom font will swap in when loaded. No significant CLS expected."
