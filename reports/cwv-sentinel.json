      "bottleneck": "CLS on mobile due to fixed-height video placeholders (450px) vs actual video height (~180px).",
      "fix": "Updated placeholders in `app/page.tsx` and loading state in `RemotionVideoEmbedWrapper.tsx` to use `aspect-video` and `max-w-[800px]`, ensuring consistent aspect ratio and width during loading.",
      "impact": "Eliminated large layout shift on mobile devices when videos load. Placeholder now matches the video dimensions exactly."

    "Condition": {
      "bottleneck": "CLS due to mismatch between 3-column skeleton and 1-column filtered content for PatientEducationVideos on Sciatica page.",
      "fix": "Replaced dynamic import with static import for PatientEducationVideos in app/conditions/sciatica-pain-treatment-hyderabad/page.tsx to render server-side immediately.",
      "impact": "Eliminated layout shift and improved LCP by removing skeleton loading state."
