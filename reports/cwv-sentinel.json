    "type": "CLS Risk (Layout Stability)",
    "description": "The placeholder for the lazy-loaded `LocalReputationPanel` on the Home page had a fixed height estimate that underestimated the mobile content height (~1350px vs 1100px) and didn't account for tablet/desktop layout differences, creating a risk of layout shift (CLS) upon scroll-triggered loading."

  "fix": {
    "description": "Refined the `LazySection` placeholder height classes in `app/page.tsx` to better match the rendered content across breakpoints.",
    "change": "Updated `h-[1100px] md:h-[600px]` to `h-[1500px] md:h-[750px] lg:h-[600px]`.",
    "impact": "Prevents layout shifts when the reputation panel loads while scrolling, maintaining visual stability."
