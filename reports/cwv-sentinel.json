  ],
  "expected_impact": "Reduced Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) on the Home Page by preventing the footer/content below from shifting down when the lazy-loaded video section hydrates/paints.",
  "verification_steps": "Manual verification involves loading the home page on a desktop viewport width (~1200px) and observing if the layout shifts when scrolling to the video section. Automated verification via `pnpm build` ensures no regressions. Note: GitHub CI failed due to billing/infrastructure issues, but local `pnpm build` and `pnpm test` passed successfully."
